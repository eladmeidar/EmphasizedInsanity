    <div class="single_post">
			<p>IE6 was, and still is the worst nightmare for web developers (client side mostly).<br />
This browser/disease who surfaced the Web years ago, still acts as a major market share holder (about 67% these days) and hurts users, developers and basically everyone who comes across it&#8217;s path.<br />
I am a web developer and there are many in my profession who can really understand this evil browser, much more than the common user who think the &#8220;internet is the blue icon&#8230;no?&#8221;, we&#8217;re still dealing with <span class="caps">CSS</span> Hacks, <span class="caps">HTML</span> and JavaScript that IE6 forced us to write, <span class="caps">PNG</span> manipulation (what did we ask for?! transparency?) and much more. <br />
So the nearing release of IE8 should be good news, right? Everybody moves up a notch, even the poor people who have to use IE6 in the working place (yeah, there are more than a couple of these companies in Israel).<br />
<br />
Not so fast. What made IE6 so bad is that it&#8217;s bugs became standards. That people accepted it&#8217;s negligence as a permanent status and began to work around it&#8217;s bugs around the clock, forcing themselves and other to years of web-desperation. <br />
On the other hand, these people web sites usually were their paychecks, so they really didn&#8217;t have too much time to wait for dear old Microsoft to release a patch/fix/update that will fix their specific bug (and probably bringing 300 other bugs), so they hack <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">HTML</span>, JavaScript and Images in order to make it work. Before they knew it, the bugs and other demented issues from the IE standard demonic bugs, have become the standard.<br />
<br />
After trying out IE8 RC1, i can say that i am worried, Tables that don&#8217;t render correctly, JavaScript calls that crash the browser into oblivion and meta tags that order the browser to render the page as IE7, get real. <br />
It&#8217;s not just the bugs, it&#8217;s the fact that the IE8 development seems to be giving these bugs the backend, it&#8217;s been there, and have been reported already in Beta (i know i did). <br />
If IE8 makes it out with this huge list of basic usage bugs, we are going on round 2 with IE6, And all of us web developers and designers will travel back in time to  2002. <br />
<br />
IE6 for my opinion was the reason that almost nothing moved around web development and web applications between 2002/3 up until FireFox came along, when there was no competition, IE rules with it&#8217;s bugs without nothing to worry about and with nobody has the ability to point out the exact things he wish to have in a browser, so Microsoft did nothing until FireFox became strong enough to threat the king.<br />
Although that i would be happy to extinguisher the very existence of the IE family, i will be very happy to see a normal, advanced browser coming from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to make sure that IE8 isn&#8217;t a new IE6 in a new outfit, get yourself a copy of IE8 and start shooting some feedback at Microsoft. Also, vote up those bugs that really need fixing. Even if you don&#8217;t use IE in your day-to-day work, if you develop web software, this is a matter of raising the bar, before they make a new one, very very low one.<br />
