  	  <p>Rails&#8217;s <a href="http://travisonrails.com/2007/02/18/Rails-eager-loading-of-associations">eager loading</a> (<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/22">ScreenCast</a>) is an important practice that saves some requests and queries when dealing with table relations in rails.<br />
Up until now, using a condition hash to specify query was a little tricky if you use the eager loading method:<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
   User.find(:all, :include =&gt; :jobs, :conditions =&gt; [&#8220;jobs.salary &gt; ?&#8221;,1000])<br />
</pre><br />
or using a hash (without eager loading)<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
   User.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; {:name =&gt; &#8217;eizesus&#8217;})<br />
</pre><br />
Using a conditions array/hash isn’t always my favorite way to write finds in Rails, but in certain cases must have when you deal with complex queries (like and &#8220;Advanced Search&#8221; feature). <br />
<br />
In my current work,I needed to run conditions on an associated table in just such an &#8220;Advanced search&#8221; feature, so i came up with this simple and easy way to use a condition hash for eager loading methods:<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
   User.find(:all, :include =&gt; :jobs, :conditions =&gt; {:name =&gt; &#8216;eizesus&#8217;, :jobs =&gt; {:position =&gt; &#8217;Manager&#8217;})<br />
</pre><br />
<br />
or you can prepare the condition hash on the fly:<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
conditions = {}<br />
conditions[:first_name] = params[:first_name] unless params[:first_name].blank?<br />
conditions[:last_name] = params[:last_name] unless params[:last_name].blank?<br />
conditions[:jobs] = {:position =&gt; params[:position]} unless params[:position].blank?</p>
<p>@users = User.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; conditions, :include =&gt; :jobs)<br />
</pre></p>

<br />
Preventing bugs before they happen, that&#8217;s the key. <br />
If you don?t prevent bug, they will start a snow ball that will force you on and on with ridiculous patch-work and what i basically call the &#8220;fire extinguishing loop&#8221;,  there will be a lot of them interacting with each other, making it difficult to figure out what?s what, and were it all began from.<br />
The majority of bugs reside in JS differences between browsers and <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">DOM</span> interpretation, so i&#8217;ll try to specify some methods and techniques we use here at my company, who make our lives a lot more easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3><span class="caps">CSS</span> Resets</h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/">asterisk <span class="caps">CSS</span> selector</a>:<br />
<pre>* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}</pre><br />
But, it&#8217;s too rough. Using this technique cause my forms to get messy and got me upset since i had to define <b>every single padding and margin</b> specification.<br />
ince then, I?ve been using the popular <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2008/01/15/resetting-again/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> reset by Eric Meyer</a>, which collects a set of such reset attributes, for several common <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags.<br />
Of course i had to tweak it to fully match my needs, but still , it&#8217;s a must-have baseline for cross browser <span class="caps">CSS</span> development.<br />
<br />
<h3>Clearing floats</h3>IE6 does not like floats too much, IE8RC1 is not a big fan either, especially when those floats are not clear.<br />
Uncleared floats are often the cause of major bugs. however, it?s a bug that is easy to fix. <br />
Setting an HR element with width of <span>1 and setting it to clear:both, will solve the problem.<br />
<code>&amp;lt;div&amp;nbsp;id=&amp;quot;container&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;nbsp;class=&amp;quot;floater&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;floating.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;nbsp;class=&amp;quot;floater&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;floating.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;hr&amp;nbsp;class=&amp;quot;clear&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;I&amp;nbsp;am&amp;nbsp;below!!&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;</code><br />
<br />
and the <span class="caps">CSS</span>:<br />
<code>#container{&lt;br /&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;
.floater{float:left, width:60px; margin:6px; padding:6px; border:2px solid #888;}&lt;br /&gt;
hr.clear{clear:both;width:1</span>;}<br />
</code><br />
<br />
ther clear:both definition orders the HR element to go down one line if the is any other element on it&#8217;s left or on it&#8217;s right, read more on the <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/clear">clear <span class="caps">CSS</span> attribute</a>.</p>

  	<div class="entrybody">
  	  <p>IE6 was, and still is the worst nightmare for web developers (client side mostly).<br />
This browser/disease who surfaced the Web years ago, still acts as a major market share holder (about 67% these days) and hurts users, developers and basically everyone who comes across it&#8217;s path.<br />
I am a web developer and there are many in my profession who can really understand this evil browser, much more than the common user who think the &#8220;internet is the blue icon&#8230;no?&#8221;, we&#8217;re still dealing with <span class="caps">CSS</span> Hacks, <span class="caps">HTML</span> and JavaScript that IE6 forced us to write, <span class="caps">PNG</span> manipulation (what did we ask for?! transparency?) and much more. <br />
So the nearing release of IE8 should be good news, right? Everybody moves up a notch, even the poor people who have to use IE6 in the working place (yeah, there are more than a couple of these companies in Israel).<br />
<br />
Not so fast. What made IE6 so bad is that it&#8217;s bugs became standards. That people accepted it&#8217;s negligence as a permanent status and began to work around it&#8217;s bugs around the clock, forcing themselves and other to years of web-desperation. <br />
On the other hand, these people web sites usually were their paychecks, so they really didn&#8217;t have too much time to wait for dear old Microsoft to release a patch/fix/update that will fix their specific bug (and probably bringing 300 other bugs), so they hack <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">HTML</span>, JavaScript and Images in order to make it work. Before they knew it, the bugs and other demented issues from the IE standard demonic bugs, have become the standard.<br />
<br />
After trying out IE8 RC1, i can say that i am worried, Tables that don&#8217;t render correctly, JavaScript calls that crash the browser into oblivion and meta tags that order the browser to render the page as IE7, get real. <br />
It&#8217;s not just the bugs, it&#8217;s the fact that the IE8 development seems to be giving these bugs the backend, it&#8217;s been there, and have been reported already in Beta (i know i did). <br />
If IE8 makes it out with this huge list of basic usage bugs, we are going on round 2 with IE6, And all of us web developers and designers will travel back in time to  2002. <br />
<br />
IE6 for my opinion was the reason that almost nothing moved around web development and web applications between 2002/3 up until FireFox came along, when there was no competition, IE rules with it&#8217;s bugs without nothing to worry about and with nobody has the ability to point out the exact things he wish to have in a browser, so Microsoft did nothing until FireFox became strong enough to threat the king.<br />
Although that i would be happy to extinguisher the very existence of the IE family, i will be very happy to see a normal, advanced browser coming from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to make sure that IE8 isn&#8217;t a new IE6 in a new outfit, get yourself a copy of IE8 and start shooting some feedback at Microsoft. Also, vote up those bugs that really need fixing. Even if you don&#8217;t use IE in your day-to-day work, if you develop web software, this is a matter of raising the bar, before they make a new one, very very low one.<br />
