<br />
One of my current consulting positions, involves a startup company with a great idea and a great social network implementation idea.<br />
For that matter, i have been scavenging the web lately for Rails based social netowrking plugins, Engines or maybe even a skeleton application for those guys and i found some very good solution apps and infrastructures, the only problem rails Rails 2.0 compatibility (which i didn&#8217;t check yet, and some don&#8217;t indicate) and Documentation, which seem to be neglected on almost all those apps.<br />
<br />
So, Here&#8217;s the current list:<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://lovdbyless.com/">LovdByLess</a></span></b><br />
include blogs, user profiles, photo uploads, forums, friendships and user-to-user messaging funcionallity.<br />
Looks great and has a great look and feel.<br />
Comes as a full application under <span class="caps">MIT</span> license.<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.communityengine.org/">CommunityEngine</a></b></span><br />
A <a href="http://rails-engines.org/">Rails engine</a>, now supports Rails 2.0.<br />
Gives you the basic functionality for a social networking site. It includes features such as User pages, forums, uploads, geo searches, blogging and more.<br />
Important to say that extending the basic engine with your own controllers and models, is supposed to be easy and simple, i am currently testing it out so i don&#8217;t really have an opinion yet.<br />
Documentation has to be improved though, a lot.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.toghq.com/"><span class="caps">TOG</span></a></b></span>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/toghq/tog-business-535002">presentation</a><br />
<span class="caps">TOG</span> is basically a package of features (in the form of plugins) which you can choose to add to your applications as one, or as a whole.<br />
<quote>Using these prepackaged and automated features should let you focus on the real key point about social networks: keep the conversation going with your members. If you’re just starting a social site or wants to polish your community with lovely social capabilities maybe you should give tog a try.</quote><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://portal.insoshi.com/">Insoshi</a></b></span><br />
Features include:<br />
<ul><li>Activity feed<br /></p>
</li>
<li>Personal profiles with photo upload and comment walls<br /></li>
<li>Internal messaging system with read/replied/trashed messages<br /></li>
<li>Contacts list</li>
<li>Blogs with comments</li>
<li>Discussion forum</li>
<li>Search for profiles, forums, and blogs</li>
<li>Admin panel with site preferences</li>
<li>Option for email verification and activity notifications</li>
<p></ul>Documentation is kind of missing here too.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.justinball.com/2008/09/15/764/">LuvFoo</a></b></span><br />
Under developement, but runs several sites at the moment,<br />
include some neat features on top of the plain simple ones, such as <span class="caps">API</span> and <span class="caps">CMS</span> intergration.<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://github.com/seven1m/onebody/tree/master">OneBody</a></b></span><br />
Although i am not sure why they indicate their audience as Churches (?), it looks like a good social framework with a lot of features such as:<br />
<ul><li>Membership Management | aka ChMS</li><br />
<li>Online Directory | search, print</li><br />
<li>Groups | email lists, attendance tracking</li><br />
<li>Social Networking | friends, favorites</li><br />
<li>Content Management System | page editing</li></p>
<p></ul>and more, read on in the <a href="http://github.com/seven1m/onebody/wikis">Wiki manual </a><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<a href="http://almosteffortless.com/eldorado/"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>El-Dorado</b></span></a><br />
Looks nice and packed, a pretty live demo site too.<br />
Features include: <br />
<ul><li>Forum</li><br />
<li>Group chat</li><br />
<li>Event calendar</li><br />
<li>File sharing</li><br />
<li>Random headers</li><br />
<li>Avatars</li><br />
<li>Themes</li><br />
<li>Privacy settings <br /></p>
</li>

This is a <strong>group chat social network application</strong>. You can start conversations and connect wih other users while discussing it.<br />
It is possible to make a conversation read-only for presenting a content too.<br />
<br />
<h3><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://openmind.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Openmind</a></span></h3><a href="http://openmind.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"><img alt="Openmind" height="131" src="http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/image/openmind.jpg" width="480" /></a><br />
<strong>Openmind</strong> enables you to create a collaborative environment for collecting the thoughts of your customers/collagues on a product/service.<br />
User can discuss online about an idea &amp; vote for the features. Admin can mark the most-requested features as &#8220;to be included in next releases&#8221; &amp; users get informed from this. A nice application for creating a constructive community.<br />

Don&#8217;t let it happen, run/compile your application every few days, keep it living in your head.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you&#8217;ll start work on some big shiny feature (e.g. adding a kewl Google maps integration), but stop because you hit a technical bump (&#8220;What? no maps for Israel?&#8221;), or don’t have the time to finish it (&#8220;Need to finish this Company profile by tomorrow&#8221;) and The source code is left in unfinished state.<br />
You can’t do anything with any of your code until this is fixed, and the longer you leave it, the more you’ll forget and the harder it will be to get started again.<br />
This is called a &#8220;broken build&#8221;, and is a big landmine because it impacts other peoples ability to work (And your ability to continue as well).<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #1: You started something? finish it before moving on to something else.<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #2: Stay in touch with your software.<br />
<h4>&#8220;I Sure could use a time machine right now&#8230;.&#8221;<br /></p>
<p></h4>Know these times when you wished you had a time machine? well, it can happen in the process of developing and application too.<br />
People make mistakes, Always. When people make mistakes in the kitchen, the food comes out really bad and you call the local pizza delivery services and solve the problem. When a programmer makes a mistake or is doing a system wide change&#8230; you&#8217;ll need a ready to use Plan B around.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Source_Control">Source Control</a> is the software world equivalent of a time machine, you can go back to a certain version of your application and rollback any changes made to your code and application, and by that, maybe reversing a very serious threat to your code.<br />
If you haven’t taken the plunge with revision control yet, I highly recommend looking at some of the <a href="http://blog.eizesus.com/2008/10/free-svngit-hosting-services.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/blog.eizesus.com');">free <span class="caps">SVN</span> or <span class="caps">GIT</span> hosting services post</a>.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #3: Save yourself, use a source control service. <br />
<h4>&#8220;Look at this cooooooolll JQuery accordation!&#8221;</h4>Features are fun, Javascript magic is amazing, but you&#8217;ll need to focus on what&#8217;s really important <br />
Focusing on things like validation, cool eye candies or extra functions is a great way to build up a large complex code base that doesn’t do anything useful yet.<br />
Focus on the core functionality of your software first — your main features should be complete before you start thinking about <span class="caps">WOW</span> stuff.<br />
Wasting trying to think of the perfect name, designing a logo or an icon, choosing the perfect open-source license and making a website won’t get you any closer to having a working application. <br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #4: Core functionality first, fun &#8211; later. <br />
<h4>Throw your code away and start from scratch &#8211; The Netscape mistake<br /></p>
<p></h4>As Netscape famously discovered a few years ago, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.joelonsoftware.com');">throwing away existing code to start afresh is almost never a good idea</a>. Resist the urge and make a series of small, manageable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">code re-factoring</a> instead.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #5: Never sink your own boat, pickup a bucket and start pulling out water <br />
<h4>Pull yourself together before you sit down<br /></p>
<p></h4>&#8220;mmm, Rails? or maybe Adobe Air? or maybe&#8230; maybe we&#8217;ll do the cool gears thing?&#8221; <br />
Before doing anything ask yourself a simple question &#8211; &#8220;What are you actually trying to achieve?&#8221;, Spend some time with a pen and some paper coming up with a really clear vision of what you’re trying to create — e.g. screen mock-ups, basic core functionality (yes, again) and if there is a process you are trying to imitate, go through it too.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #6:&nbsp; If you don’t know what you’re doing from the beginning, you’ll have no chance of finishing it.<br />
<br />
<h4>Get the right men for the job</h4>You maybe a coding genius, a super-programmer (<a href="http://www.actionrails.com/about.html">Mike</a> it&#8217;s you) or other superior programming entity. but unless you are a really something no one had ever seen before, you don&#8217;t know anything there is to know about every aspect of developing a new software and a products.<br />
If you can&#8217;t tell the difference between red and green, get a designer to work for you. if you don&#8217;t have a clue in <span class="caps">CSS</span> or DB infrastructure, get someone who know this art to do it.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #7: Do what you know, not what you don&#8217;t know.<br />
<br />
<h4>Marketing is Important, but when it&#8217;s time<br /></p>
<p></h4>Tell people about your product when you have something to show, open a product twitter account when you have something to say, don&#8217;t rush yourself forward and try to stick the product or create a hype when you can&#8217;t back it up by at least screenshots or an actual product on the best scenario.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #8: Invite people in when you have something to offer them to eat.<br />
<br />
<h4>The difference between a lie and a promise</h4>Users don&#8217;t mind waiting for features, they mind finding out you promised them something and didn&#8217;t deliver.<br />
Stand up to your words, and update your users about development progress and new features on the way, as long as you really intend to do it and not just saying to make them download or register.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #9: Users are like your mother, lie to them, and they&#8217;ll know.</p>

   User.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; {:name =&gt; &#8217;eizesus&#8217;})<br />
</pre><br />
Using a conditions array/hash isn’t always my favorite way to write finds in Rails, but in certain cases must have when you deal with complex queries (like and &#8220;Advanced Search&#8221; feature). <br />
<br />
In my current work,I needed to run conditions on an associated table in just such an &#8220;Advanced search&#8221; feature, so i came up with this simple and easy way to use a condition hash for eager loading methods:<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
   User.find(:all, :include =&gt; :jobs, :conditions =&gt; {:name =&gt; &#8216;eizesus&#8217;, :jobs =&gt; {:position =&gt; &#8217;Manager&#8217;})<br />
</pre><br />
<br />
or you can prepare the condition hash on the fly:<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
conditions = {}<br />
conditions[:first_name] = params[:first_name] unless params[:first_name].blank?<br />
conditions[:last_name] = params[:last_name] unless params[:last_name].blank?<br />
conditions[:jobs] = {:position =&gt; params[:position]} unless params[:position].blank?</p>
<p>@users = User.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; conditions, :include =&gt; :jobs)<br />
</pre></p>

Preventing bugs before they happen, that&#8217;s the key. <br />
If you don?t prevent bug, they will start a snow ball that will force you on and on with ridiculous patch-work and what i basically call the &#8220;fire extinguishing loop&#8221;,  there will be a lot of them interacting with each other, making it difficult to figure out what?s what, and were it all began from.<br />
The majority of bugs reside in JS differences between browsers and <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">DOM</span> interpretation, so i&#8217;ll try to specify some methods and techniques we use here at my company, who make our lives a lot more easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3><span class="caps">CSS</span> Resets</h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/">asterisk <span class="caps">CSS</span> selector</a>:<br />
<pre>* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}</pre><br />
But, it&#8217;s too rough. Using this technique cause my forms to get messy and got me upset since i had to define <b>every single padding and margin</b> specification.<br />
ince then, I?ve been using the popular <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2008/01/15/resetting-again/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> reset by Eric Meyer</a>, which collects a set of such reset attributes, for several common <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags.<br />
Of course i had to tweak it to fully match my needs, but still , it&#8217;s a must-have baseline for cross browser <span class="caps">CSS</span> development.<br />
<br />
<h3>Clearing floats</h3>IE6 does not like floats too much, IE8RC1 is not a big fan either, especially when those floats are not clear.<br />
Uncleared floats are often the cause of major bugs. however, it?s a bug that is easy to fix. <br />
Setting an HR element with width of <span>1 and setting it to clear:both, will solve the problem.<br />
<code>&amp;lt;div&amp;nbsp;id=&amp;quot;container&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;nbsp;class=&amp;quot;floater&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;floating.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;nbsp;class=&amp;quot;floater&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;floating.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;hr&amp;nbsp;class=&amp;quot;clear&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;I&amp;nbsp;am&amp;nbsp;below!!&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;</code><br />
<br />
and the <span class="caps">CSS</span>:<br />
<code>#container{&lt;br /&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;
.floater{float:left, width:60px; margin:6px; padding:6px; border:2px solid #888;}&lt;br /&gt;
hr.clear{clear:both;width:1</span>;}<br />
</code><br />
<br />
ther clear:both definition orders the HR element to go down one line if the is any other element on it&#8217;s left or on it&#8217;s right, read more on the <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/clear">clear <span class="caps">CSS</span> attribute</a>.</p>

  	  <p>IE6 was, and still is the worst nightmare for web developers (client side mostly).<br />
This browser/disease who surfaced the Web years ago, still acts as a major market share holder (about 67% these days) and hurts users, developers and basically everyone who comes across it&#8217;s path.<br />
I am a web developer and there are many in my profession who can really understand this evil browser, much more than the common user who think the &#8220;internet is the blue icon&#8230;no?&#8221;, we&#8217;re still dealing with <span class="caps">CSS</span> Hacks, <span class="caps">HTML</span> and JavaScript that IE6 forced us to write, <span class="caps">PNG</span> manipulation (what did we ask for?! transparency?) and much more. <br />
So the nearing release of IE8 should be good news, right? Everybody moves up a notch, even the poor people who have to use IE6 in the working place (yeah, there are more than a couple of these companies in Israel).<br />
<br />
Not so fast. What made IE6 so bad is that it&#8217;s bugs became standards. That people accepted it&#8217;s negligence as a permanent status and began to work around it&#8217;s bugs around the clock, forcing themselves and other to years of web-desperation. <br />
On the other hand, these people web sites usually were their paychecks, so they really didn&#8217;t have too much time to wait for dear old Microsoft to release a patch/fix/update that will fix their specific bug (and probably bringing 300 other bugs), so they hack <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">HTML</span>, JavaScript and Images in order to make it work. Before they knew it, the bugs and other demented issues from the IE standard demonic bugs, have become the standard.<br />
<br />
After trying out IE8 RC1, i can say that i am worried, Tables that don&#8217;t render correctly, JavaScript calls that crash the browser into oblivion and meta tags that order the browser to render the page as IE7, get real. <br />
It&#8217;s not just the bugs, it&#8217;s the fact that the IE8 development seems to be giving these bugs the backend, it&#8217;s been there, and have been reported already in Beta (i know i did). <br />
If IE8 makes it out with this huge list of basic usage bugs, we are going on round 2 with IE6, And all of us web developers and designers will travel back in time to  2002. <br />
<br />
IE6 for my opinion was the reason that almost nothing moved around web development and web applications between 2002/3 up until FireFox came along, when there was no competition, IE rules with it&#8217;s bugs without nothing to worry about and with nobody has the ability to point out the exact things he wish to have in a browser, so Microsoft did nothing until FireFox became strong enough to threat the king.<br />
Although that i would be happy to extinguisher the very existence of the IE family, i will be very happy to see a normal, advanced browser coming from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to make sure that IE8 isn&#8217;t a new IE6 in a new outfit, get yourself a copy of IE8 and start shooting some feedback at Microsoft. Also, vote up those bugs that really need fixing. Even if you don&#8217;t use IE in your day-to-day work, if you develop web software, this is a matter of raising the bar, before they make a new one, very very low one.<br />

  	  <p>First thing, it helps.<br />
Exactly the same as in Server side languages and client side languages, frameworks are a great improvement (in most cases) to a regular off the board development.<br />

  	  <quote><abbr title="Unified Modeling Language"><span class="caps">UML</span></abbr> is a Graphical language for visualizing, specifying and constructing the artifacts of a software-intensive system. The Unified Modeling Language offers a standard way to write a system&#8217;s blueprints, including conceptual components such as business processes and system functions as well as concrete things such as programming language statements, database schemas, and reusable software components.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <span class="caps">UML</span> combines the best practice from data modeling concepts such as entity relationship diagrams, business modeling (work flow), object modeling and component modeling. It can be used with all processes, throughout the software development life cycle, and across different implementation technologies.</quote><p><br />
As the strategic value of software increases for many companies, the industry looks for techniques to automate the production of software and to improve quality and reduce cost and time-to-market. <br />
These techniques include component technology, visual programming, patterns and frameworks. Businesses also seek techniques to manage the complexity of systems as they increase in scope and scale. In particular, they recognize the need to solve recurring architectural problems, such as physical distribution, concurrency, replication, security, load balancing and fault tolerance. Additionally, the development for the World Wide Web, while making some things simpler, has exacerbated these architectural problems. The Unified Modeling Language (<span class="caps">UML</span>) was designed to respond to these needs and to supply the programmers and the project managers with a visual application state and layout.<br />
There isn&#8217;t a clear why to implement the usage of <span class="caps">UML</span> for rails development, but here are the tools i did find.<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://railroad.rubyforge.org/">RailsRoad</a> is a RailRoad is a class diagrams generator for Ruby on Rails applications. It&#8217;s a Ruby script that loads the application classes and analyzes its properties (attributes, methods) and relationships (inheritance, model associations like has_many, etc.) The output is a graph description in the <span class="caps">DOT</span> language, suitable to be handled with tools like Graphviz. <i>Last tested on old rails versions!</i></li><br />
<li>A <a href="http://resource.visual-paradigm.com/vpsuite3.1/instant_generate_ruby.html">visual paradigm plugin</a> for generating ruby (yap, not rails)</li><br />
<li><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-uml/">ruby-uml</a>, couldn&#8217;t find any documentations. <br /></p>
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://branch14.org/ruby_on_rails/plugins/generate_from_uml/">generate_from_uml</a> plugin does the oppsite and enerates rails models from a <span class="caps">UML</span> schema, i didn&#8217;t see how advanced relations are handled though (:has_many :through for example)</li>
