  	  <p>Since i had to handle so much crap with Facebook, Rails and the Facebooker plugin in order to get my latest application up, i decided to share a little bit with other innocent coders straying in the path of hell.<br />
<br />
The Facebooker plugin interfaces with the Facebook <span class="caps">API</span> using the Net::<span class="caps">HTTP</span> ruby library and POSTs <span class="caps">API</span> requests (<span class="caps">API</span> call, <span class="caps">FQL</span>..) using the #post method (eventually, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of stuff happening before that).<br />
It sounds nice, it really does, problem is that in this specific app we have send a whole bunch of such requests to facebook, some requests return 1000-17,000+ strings back as <span class="caps">JSON</span>&#8230;. what makes Facebook simply.. stale.<br />
<br />
Now getting like 3,400 Timeout exceptions raised in your production servers (adding that the <span class="caps">CPU</span> is on 3.2%, <span class="caps">RAM</span> is at 10%) is annoying. really annoying.<br />
<br />
The &#8220;patch&#8221; we found for this issue was to ensure a specific amount of retries to be made by rescuing the Timeout Exception.<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
def get_my_somefing_from_fb<br />
    retry_count = 0<br />
    begin<br />
        do facebook crap<br />
    rescue TimeoutError<br />
        if (retry_count &lt; 5)<br />
           retry_count+=1<br />
        end<br />
    end<br />
end<br />
</pre><br />
<br />
Now we are watching it closely to see exactly how it helps us, if at all.</p>

  	  <p>Everyone wants to be a big bad rock star entrepreneur, wake up to that morning when your bank account is flooded by plain cold cash, you are making millions while sitting at home and watching the download meter of your software or user count of your web site flying sky high every day.<br />
Well, it&#8217;s possible, many people have done that, and the nice thing about the web/internet world, is that there will be always, always, enough to share.<br />
But it&#8217;s a long way, and as the nature of things that take long, they tend to break our spirit, get us bored and insecure and afraid of competition.<br />
I have gathered around a few misconceptions about startups and entrepreneurship, misconceptions that most people around this business seems to posses, but those who won&#8217;t, these are the ones who break forward.<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #1 &#8211; &#8220;Fast, Fast, Fast&#8221;</b><br />
Well, shortly.. NO!<br />
Nothing is more important than keeping your startup organized, Clear and planned ahead. Programming fast does not guarantee a better product, Designing, looking around a bit and gathering the baseline on which your consist your product, does guarantee a better product.<br />
Get yourself a clear milestone plan, point out Alpha version (Standalone <span class="caps">POC</span>), private beta (for users you self pick) and a public beta, and stick with this plan!.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #2 &#8211; &#8220;We&#8217;ll grow with it&#8221;</b><br />
Scaling&#8230; people seem to forget about it, more like avoid it until the &#8220;twitter/dzone/digg affect&#8221; hit&#8217;s their home page.<br />
Web application tend to collect more users in a period of time than a downloaded software, web applications are also a single point of service (in case of SaaS), so you&#8217;d better get your system infrastructure ready and available for a user boost one day or another, viral marketing can be a dangerous thing.<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #3 &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough&#8221;</b><br />
i&#8217;ve heard people say &#8220;if this project doesn&#8217;t go public in 5 months, i am out&#8221; or &#8220;i can&#8217;t work with this people, i&#8217;m out&#8221;. There&#8217;s a word for people like that.<br />
quitters.<br />
and quitters don&#8217;t get rich.<br />
The people you work with may be annoying as hell, stupid as hell or useless as hell, if you truly believe in the concept of the idea, don&#8217;t let anyone else&#8217;s negligence to take what is yours and do everything you can (and you <span class="caps">ALWAYS</span> can) to get the startup up and running.<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #4 &#8211; &#8220;We need more money&#8221;</b><br />
Sometimes you do, sometimes you don&#8217;t.<br />
In order to get a website up and running these days, ready and eager to handle thousands of users, you only need <span class="caps">AWS</span>, which if you exaggerate like hell with your configuration, you&#8217;ll get to 1000$ a month.<br />
So following my previous post, you should know that one or more of your partners must be able to supply you with technical solutions (system administration, coding) so this should almost never be counted as an expense.<br />
Most of the most successful startups were not founded, ever. keep that in mind.</p>

  	  <p>Through the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been working on a facebook application, one of this year&#8217;s todo list items, with my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/liors">Lior Levin</a>.<br />
Well, it&#8217;s been hell.<br />
Not because of Lior :), but becasue of Facebook&#8217;s horrible horrible <span class="caps">API</span>, i haven&#8217;t seen such a bad <span class="caps">API</span> implementation since working on a <a href="http://www.tranzila.com/english.html">Tranzila</a> Credit card gateway in Israel, two years ago.<br />
The facebook api and the entire application-programming-guidelines are idiotic, they offer the support of iFrame applications.<br />
&#8220;good, actually great&#8221; you think.. &#8220;at least i woun&#8217;t have to use the crappy <span class="caps">FBML</span> mishmash thingie&#8230; and i can use JQuery!&#8221; &#8211; But you are wrong, although all of these things are true, using the iFrame interface you are not touching any <span class="caps">FBML</span> crap and can use any JS Framework you&#8217;d like, but the horrors&#8230; the horrors.<br />
First of all, each applications must have a set of callbacks assigned in the application&#8217;s setting page: callback for application main gate, post authorization, post remove and another thing that doesn&#8217;t matter now.<br />
No RESTful web service support what so ever, except for the main application page, all other callbacks are POSTs, what&#8217;s the problem?<br />
When being a loyal Rails developer, you&#8217;d use RESTful routes almost by default, it&#8217;s just right, but what do you do when Facebook decides that user removal actions should be POSTed and not DELETEd? you fuck up your routes.rb to match that, great.<br />
The iFrame is a whole different story, if a user is yet to add your application, he will be redirected to an &#8220;Allow application to do this and that&#8221; page, what&#8217;s the problem? that the redirection happend <span class="caps">WITHIN</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">IFRAME</span>! which basically now causes the user to see a double facebook top bar from that moment until he refreshes the entire screen.<br />
Crap.<br />
It took me a while but i found a way passed it by flagging the first time a user comes in, and JS redirect the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cpurs2">top</a> document to an hard coded application url.<br />
<br />
In this whole mess there was a single light in the end of the tunnel, which is the <a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">Facebooker plugin</a>, which work great but it&#8217;s documentation and online tutorial basically suck.<br />
Maybe i&#8217;ll do a new one&#8230; <br />
done.</p>

  		<h2><a href="/2009/02/startup-thoughts-sharing-the-cake-2">Startup Thoughts: Sharing the cake</a> <span class="author"> by Elad Meidar</span></h2> 
  		<h3>20 Feb 2009 | <a href="/2009/02/startup-thoughts-sharing-the-cake-2#disqus_thread" class="commentslink">View comments</a></h3>
  	</div>
  	
  	<div class="entrybody">
  	  <p>I&#8217;ve been involved in several startup projects lately. I the majority of them, one of the main reasons why founders and equity owners start to fight one another, is the moment in which someone thinks some equity needs to be shared with someone else, out side the current equity holders circle.<br />
<br />
Well, nobody likes to give out equity and it&#8217;s hard to know when and tho whom such company/project holdings should be granted.<br />
The option of giving out equity, is mostly driven by the fact the founders need money to make their idea come to life, money or an equivalent needed resource (advisers, tech people). When there is no money, you need to ask yourself one question.<br />
<quote>Do i <span class="caps">REAALLLY</span> need it?</quote>.<br />
They say that holding 100% of 0, is 0.. and they are right, if you will hold your equity holdings close to the chest and refuse to share no matter what, you&#8217;ll probably heading straight down the hill. But on the other hand, giving out equity for anyone who wants some, or giving unreasonable amounts for that matter, is same as bad.<br />
<br />
You can&#8217;t do anything by yourself, you have to share your idea with some other people (unless you are really something special).<br />
The first time you share your project equity with the other founders is simple and easy, most of the time the equity will be divided equally (and it doesn&#8217;t matter who brought the idea, it&#8217;s irrelevant) among the founders, stated in a partnership agreement later to be replaced by and incorporated entity legal documents.<br />
<br />
Now when it gets to expanding the circle, there are two kinds of entrepreneurs that i can across with:<br />
<ol><li><b>Hard<i></i></b> &#8211; These guys are either possessed with a too-high-self-confidence and sure that they can make it to the finish line without sharing a 0.1% with anyone else except for the initial founder circle or people with a wise project-wide view of things and insists of not giving away equity until it&#8217;s absolutely necessary. He believe that any problem can be solved either by finding other forms of getting the required service/resource and will do whatever necessary in order to make things work out without having to release equity or unnecessary funds.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to distinct between these two sides of the Hard Core entrepreneur, but if you have the second kind of person in your team, you are a winner.</li><br />
<li><b>Soft<i></i></b> &#8211; The soft entrepreneur is the the person who will be willing to give away anything for a little help. They will prefer to give away equity as much as possible like hot buns when it&#8217;s not necessary and not required.</li><br />
<li><b>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care&#8221;<i></i></b> &#8211; people who prefer not to take a stand, and will leave everything in the hands of other founder or all the others together. While this can be very useful when he goes your way, it&#8217;s a problem when he&#8217;s not.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<p></ol><b>So how you make the decision?</b><br />
I don&#8217;t believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/workplace_democracy">workplace democracy</a>, not all the time. <b>Sharing equity should be unanimously passed if it is taken in a vote matter</b>, or by a single responsible position holder (<span class="caps">CEO</span> for ex.).<br />
Each one of the initial founders holds his share for a reason, he earned by contibuting to the success of the project and therefore should not be downsized unless he agrees.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are not giving out equity to whoever comes your path, this list of people you should consider giving equaty to in exchage to their services.<br />
<ul><li>External <span class="caps">CEO</span> &#8211; You know how to program and design, but you don&#8217;t know nothing about the business world and need someone else to guide your project to success. An external <span class="caps">CEO</span> is a good solution for that as long as he really understands what your idea is all about, what rarely happen.<br />
Nobody knows your product better than you or your fellow founders for my opinion, but if you need a <span class="caps">CEO</span>, grant out about 10-12%.</li><br />
<li>Venture Capital Firm &#8211; The start-up Messiah, will generally have their own demands but it will move around 20%-60%.</li><br />
<li>Strategic Investment &#8211; Someone who has the capabilities to bring your product to your desired market, audience and exposure. Depends on what he can give you, the appropriate share for such a service is 13-17%.</li><br />
<li>Angel &#8211; A small financial investment that it&#8217;s entire purpose is to get things running. 10%-15% is enough, but note that if it&#8217;s a first financial investment, it&#8217;s also sets your company value. (10% for 25K, brings your company to a 250,000 value, and your share grows as well.</li><br />
<li>Tech Services &#8211; If you are going for a tech related project, such as a website or a software, <b>make sure the other founders can supply as much as possible from the project&#8217;s technical requirements</b>, if you didn&#8217;t (bad) and still need these services, grant about 0.2% for a programmer and 3%-4% for a team leader.<br /></p>
</li>
<p></ul>Kinds of people that should never get an equity share are: lawyers, advisers, sales persons and such.<br />
Keep in mind that anything that can wait, should wait and the Internet is a pretty big place for you to find what this people will probably charge 100$ an hour to tell you.<br />
When you do need a lawyer or counseling, pay the money and that&#8217;s it, no equity for counseling.<br />
<br />
Last thing, keep in mind that there are wolves out there, people who seek to only find young, naive entrepreneur to which they can sell any dreams they want.<br />
Consider every offer, but make the most to avoid sharing if you can, and if you do, share as little as possible.</p>

<br />
One of my current consulting positions, involves a startup company with a great idea and a great social network implementation idea.<br />
For that matter, i have been scavenging the web lately for Rails based social netowrking plugins, Engines or maybe even a skeleton application for those guys and i found some very good solution apps and infrastructures, the only problem rails Rails 2.0 compatibility (which i didn&#8217;t check yet, and some don&#8217;t indicate) and Documentation, which seem to be neglected on almost all those apps.<br />
<br />
So, Here&#8217;s the current list:<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://lovdbyless.com/">LovdByLess</a></span></b><br />
include blogs, user profiles, photo uploads, forums, friendships and user-to-user messaging funcionallity.<br />
Looks great and has a great look and feel.<br />
Comes as a full application under <span class="caps">MIT</span> license.<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.communityengine.org/">CommunityEngine</a></b></span><br />
A <a href="http://rails-engines.org/">Rails engine</a>, now supports Rails 2.0.<br />
Gives you the basic functionality for a social networking site. It includes features such as User pages, forums, uploads, geo searches, blogging and more.<br />
Important to say that extending the basic engine with your own controllers and models, is supposed to be easy and simple, i am currently testing it out so i don&#8217;t really have an opinion yet.<br />
Documentation has to be improved though, a lot.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.toghq.com/"><span class="caps">TOG</span></a></b></span>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/toghq/tog-business-535002">presentation</a><br />
<span class="caps">TOG</span> is basically a package of features (in the form of plugins) which you can choose to add to your applications as one, or as a whole.<br />
<quote>Using these prepackaged and automated features should let you focus on the real key point about social networks: keep the conversation going with your members. If you’re just starting a social site or wants to polish your community with lovely social capabilities maybe you should give tog a try.</quote><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://portal.insoshi.com/">Insoshi</a></b></span><br />
Features include:<br />
<ul><li>Activity feed<br /></p>
</li>
<li>Personal profiles with photo upload and comment walls<br /></li>
<li>Internal messaging system with read/replied/trashed messages<br /></li>
<li>Contacts list</li>
<li>Blogs with comments</li>
<li>Discussion forum</li>
<li>Search for profiles, forums, and blogs</li>
<li>Admin panel with site preferences</li>
<li>Option for email verification and activity notifications</li>
<p></ul>Documentation is kind of missing here too.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.justinball.com/2008/09/15/764/">LuvFoo</a></b></span><br />
Under developement, but runs several sites at the moment,<br />
include some neat features on top of the plain simple ones, such as <span class="caps">API</span> and <span class="caps">CMS</span> intergration.<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://github.com/seven1m/onebody/tree/master">OneBody</a></b></span><br />
Although i am not sure why they indicate their audience as Churches (?), it looks like a good social framework with a lot of features such as:<br />
<ul><li>Membership Management | aka ChMS</li><br />
<li>Online Directory | search, print</li><br />
<li>Groups | email lists, attendance tracking</li><br />
<li>Social Networking | friends, favorites</li><br />
<li>Content Management System | page editing</li></p>
<p></ul>and more, read on in the <a href="http://github.com/seven1m/onebody/wikis">Wiki manual </a><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<a href="http://almosteffortless.com/eldorado/"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>El-Dorado</b></span></a><br />
Looks nice and packed, a pretty live demo site too.<br />
Features include: <br />
<ul><li>Forum</li><br />
<li>Group chat</li><br />
<li>Event calendar</li><br />
<li>File sharing</li><br />
<li>Random headers</li><br />
<li>Avatars</li><br />
<li>Themes</li><br />

</li>

This is a <strong>group chat social network application</strong>. You can start conversations and connect wih other users while discussing it.<br />
It is possible to make a conversation read-only for presenting a content too.<br />
<br />

<strong>Openmind</strong> enables you to create a collaborative environment for collecting the thoughts of your customers/collagues on a product/service.<br />
User can discuss online about an idea &amp; vote for the features. Admin can mark the most-requested features as &#8220;to be included in next releases&#8221; &amp; users get informed from this. A nice application for creating a constructive community.<br />

Don&#8217;t let it happen, run/compile your application every few days, keep it living in your head.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you&#8217;ll start work on some big shiny feature (e.g. adding a kewl Google maps integration), but stop because you hit a technical bump (&#8220;What? no maps for Israel?&#8221;), or don’t have the time to finish it (&#8220;Need to finish this Company profile by tomorrow&#8221;) and The source code is left in unfinished state.<br />
You can’t do anything with any of your code until this is fixed, and the longer you leave it, the more you’ll forget and the harder it will be to get started again.<br />
This is called a &#8220;broken build&#8221;, and is a big landmine because it impacts other peoples ability to work (And your ability to continue as well).<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #1: You started something? finish it before moving on to something else.<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #2: Stay in touch with your software.<br />
<h4>&#8220;I Sure could use a time machine right now&#8230;.&#8221;<br /></p>
<p></h4>Know these times when you wished you had a time machine? well, it can happen in the process of developing and application too.<br />
People make mistakes, Always. When people make mistakes in the kitchen, the food comes out really bad and you call the local pizza delivery services and solve the problem. When a programmer makes a mistake or is doing a system wide change&#8230; you&#8217;ll need a ready to use Plan B around.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Source_Control">Source Control</a> is the software world equivalent of a time machine, you can go back to a certain version of your application and rollback any changes made to your code and application, and by that, maybe reversing a very serious threat to your code.<br />
If you haven’t taken the plunge with revision control yet, I highly recommend looking at some of the <a href="http://blog.eizesus.com/2008/10/free-svngit-hosting-services.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/blog.eizesus.com');">free <span class="caps">SVN</span> or <span class="caps">GIT</span> hosting services post</a>.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #3: Save yourself, use a source control service. <br />
<h4>&#8220;Look at this cooooooolll JQuery accordation!&#8221;</h4>Features are fun, Javascript magic is amazing, but you&#8217;ll need to focus on what&#8217;s really important <br />
Focusing on things like validation, cool eye candies or extra functions is a great way to build up a large complex code base that doesn’t do anything useful yet.<br />
Focus on the core functionality of your software first — your main features should be complete before you start thinking about <span class="caps">WOW</span> stuff.<br />
Wasting trying to think of the perfect name, designing a logo or an icon, choosing the perfect open-source license and making a website won’t get you any closer to having a working application. <br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #4: Core functionality first, fun &#8211; later. <br />
<h4>Throw your code away and start from scratch &#8211; The Netscape mistake<br /></p>
<p></h4>As Netscape famously discovered a few years ago, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.joelonsoftware.com');">throwing away existing code to start afresh is almost never a good idea</a>. Resist the urge and make a series of small, manageable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">code re-factoring</a> instead.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #5: Never sink your own boat, pickup a bucket and start pulling out water <br />
<h4>Pull yourself together before you sit down<br /></p>
<p></h4>&#8220;mmm, Rails? or maybe Adobe Air? or maybe&#8230; maybe we&#8217;ll do the cool gears thing?&#8221; <br />
Before doing anything ask yourself a simple question &#8211; &#8220;What are you actually trying to achieve?&#8221;, Spend some time with a pen and some paper coming up with a really clear vision of what you’re trying to create — e.g. screen mock-ups, basic core functionality (yes, again) and if there is a process you are trying to imitate, go through it too.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #6:&nbsp; If you don’t know what you’re doing from the beginning, you’ll have no chance of finishing it.<br />
<br />
<h4>Get the right men for the job</h4>You maybe a coding genius, a super-programmer (<a href="http://www.actionrails.com/about.html">Mike</a> it&#8217;s you) or other superior programming entity. but unless you are a really something no one had ever seen before, you don&#8217;t know anything there is to know about every aspect of developing a new software and a products.<br />
If you can&#8217;t tell the difference between red and green, get a designer to work for you. if you don&#8217;t have a clue in <span class="caps">CSS</span> or DB infrastructure, get someone who know this art to do it.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #7: Do what you know, not what you don&#8217;t know.<br />
<br />
<h4>Marketing is Important, but when it&#8217;s time<br /></p>
<p></h4>Tell people about your product when you have something to show, open a product twitter account when you have something to say, don&#8217;t rush yourself forward and try to stick the product or create a hype when you can&#8217;t back it up by at least screenshots or an actual product on the best scenario.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #8: Invite people in when you have something to offer them to eat.<br />
<br />
<h4>The difference between a lie and a promise</h4>Users don&#8217;t mind waiting for features, they mind finding out you promised them something and didn&#8217;t deliver.<br />
Stand up to your words, and update your users about development progress and new features on the way, as long as you really intend to do it and not just saying to make them download or register.<br />
<br />
<span class="caps">TIP</span> #9: Users are like your mother, lie to them, and they&#8217;ll know.</p>
