  	  <quote>Raphaël is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web. If you want to create your own specific chart or image crop and rotate widget, for example, you can achieve it simply and easily with this library.<br /></quote><p><br />
<br />
<br />
Raphael Supports Firefox 3.0+, Safari 3.0+, Opera 9.5+ and Internet Explorer 6.0+ which is pretty awesome and allows you to do almost any graphic task you have in mind, just check the demos.<br />
Raphael weighs about 110kb uncompressed, which is kind of an issue i think.<br />

  	<div class="entrybody">
  	  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div align="center"><img src="http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/funny-pictures-kitten-looks-for-bugs-in-your-computer.jpg" style="max-width: 800px;" /></div><p>Most web applications that i know, are based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/interpreted_script_languages">interpreted script languages</a> (<span class="caps">PHP</span>, Ruby, Python) and some are compiled (.Net, Java). The complied languages often (if not always) come with a full environment, <span class="caps">IDE</span> and a debugger for the server side code, the interpreted languages aren&#8217;t and the developer is more than ofter required to load the application and page in order to check for syntax error and use debug prints as the most basic tool of debugging.<br />
Javascript is an exception, it&#8217;s a de-facto web development script language, but it&#8217;s rendering engine and debugging options vary from browser to browser.<br />
I gathered up a list of common web debugging tools for Javascript. i will be happy to get some more ideas from everyone.<br />
here we go:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><u>The ultimate solution &#8211; Firebug addon</u></span><br />
ok, i know what you might say: &#8220;it&#8217;s a <b><span class="caps">FIREFOX</span></b> addon!, how can it be <b><span class="caps">THE</span></b> ultimate solution?&#8221;.<br />
Well, good news.<br />
Along side the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">plain firefox addon</a>, there&#8217;s also a <a href="http://getfirebug.com/lite.html">lite version</a> that runs as a seperate javascript on Safari, Opera and yes, IE.<br />
The Lite version is not as comprehensive as the addon, but it&#8217;s more than a blessing when dealing with IE javascript bugs (&#8220;line:33, char:33 crap&#8221;).<br />
<big><big><u><br />
<span style="font-size: x-large;"> General</span><br />
<br />
</u></big></big><span style="font-size: large;"><u><span class="caps">JSLINT</span>.<span class="caps">COM</span> &#8211; Javascript verifier</u></span><br />
Just paste your JS code and let <a href="http://jslint.com/">this cute little tool</a> and watch the Javascript errors flow back at you. important to add that it does not recognize frameworks conventions (the jQuery $ selector is considered as a Global definition, use JQuery instead) and will not identify browser specific issues, it&#8217;s marely a javascript syntax checker.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><u>BlackBird.js &#8211; Cross browser javascript logger</u></span><br />
<a href="http://www.gscottolson.com/blackbirdjs/">Blackbird</a> offers a dead-simple way to log messages in JavaScript and an attractive console to view and filter them.<br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-size: x-large;">Internet Explorer &#8211; Evil, annoying, can&#8217;t we just drop it?</span></u><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">DebugBar &#8211; Firebug&#8217;s little brother</span><br />
<a href="http://www.debugbar.com/">debugbar</a> is a nice Firebug mockup for IE, simple but not as strong as Firebug. problems are that it&#8217;s not free, and you&#8217;ll have to install a whole lot of crap on your computer. too bad.<br />
you can also checkout the <a href="http://www.debugbar.com/">Compainion.js </a>free version of a javascript console for IE.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><u>IE Developer Toolbar &#8211; <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, no Javascript</u></span><br />
Let&#8217;s face it, the IE&#8217;s so-called javascript engine just sucks, any attempt they&#8217;ll do to fix it must start by simply re-fuckin-write it.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&amp;displaylang=en">The IE Developer Toolbar</a> is a poor attempt to find a solution for some of the problems facing a web developer when dealing with IE, but at least it&#8217;s something.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><u>Safari &#8211; When i am not working, that&#8217;s the one.</u></span><br />
<small>*by saying Safari, i mean the MacOS one, not that fucked up Windows version, yak.</small><br />
<br />
Safari came from Apple, so it&#8217;s probably padded with thought, intention and considiration to any kind of end-user, as well as a developer.<br />
The Safari developer tools are nice, from a very descriptive, good looking Console and Network stats, to a rendering engine that can mimic other browsers (although i am not sure how good it is.).<br />
This &#8220;&#8221;http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2008/07/how-to-debug-ja.html&quot;&gt;How to Debug Javascript in Safari</a>&quot; article contains all you&#8217;ll need to know.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><u>FireFox &#8211; by the developers, for the developers</u></span><br />
<br />
I have to say it, but if you made it this far and you still havn&#8217;t figured out how to debug Javascript in Firefox, you have a problem.<br />
Debugging Javascript is all about the Addons engine. This huge gallery contains a lot of web development related addons and tools, just go there and pick what you want.<br />
Two addons you&#8217;ll have to pay attention to are the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60&amp;ei=wRO3SaPPAsfF-Qa667yoCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUVF7khWlu3hEcvCYGpgJ6AGW5tA">Web Developer toolbar</a> addon, and <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> we&#8217;ve mentioned before.<br />

Youre essentially communicating back and forth with your own server; no middleman. <span class="caps">FBML</span> requires that you return your content, which can contain html and fbml, back to Facebook. They parse it and render your content.<br/></li><li>Javascript/Ajax considerations. <span class="caps">FBML</span> application type parses all your css and javascript and prepend all styles and methods with a unique app number such that all methods go from do_this() to something like, app_23423423_do_this(). This creates a lot of extra work for you, especially if you are using Ajax in your app. Further more,?  some events are not allowed at all, while listeners are allowed.<br/></li><li>iframe allows you to develop locally.</li><li>Rails and RESTful routing. If your application takes advantage or RESTful routing and you choose <span class="caps">FBML</span> you will be required to adjust for the fact that all requests to your callback url from Facebook are <span class="caps">POST</span> requests, which obviously is a pretty big problem.</li><li><br/></li><p></ul> <p>There are some things you dont get, but they are mainly UI things like the styles and tabs that make your content look more like Facebook content. Even if you choose iframe, you can pass the param</p><p><code>fb_force_mode=fbml</code> to take advantage of the things that really are useful such as the request forms and other <span class="caps">FBML</span> tags (therefore the hybrid theory :) )</p>  </div><br/><br/><div class='zemanta-pixie'><img src='http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=cd99ae68-ad06-4ddc-9b1c-684f04450ede' class='zemanta-pixie-img'/></div></div></p>

  	  <p>Since i had to handle so much crap with Facebook, Rails and the Facebooker plugin in order to get my latest application up, i decided to share a little bit with other innocent coders straying in the path of hell.<br />
<br />
The Facebooker plugin interfaces with the Facebook <span class="caps">API</span> using the Net::<span class="caps">HTTP</span> ruby library and POSTs <span class="caps">API</span> requests (<span class="caps">API</span> call, <span class="caps">FQL</span>..) using the #post method (eventually, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of stuff happening before that).<br />
It sounds nice, it really does, problem is that in this specific app we have send a whole bunch of such requests to facebook, some requests return 1000-17,000+ strings back as <span class="caps">JSON</span>&#8230;. what makes Facebook simply.. stale.<br />
<br />
Now getting like 3,400 Timeout exceptions raised in your production servers (adding that the <span class="caps">CPU</span> is on 3.2%, <span class="caps">RAM</span> is at 10%) is annoying. really annoying.<br />
<br />
The &#8220;patch&#8221; we found for this issue was to ensure a specific amount of retries to be made by rescuing the Timeout Exception.<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby"><br />
def get_my_somefing_from_fb<br />
    retry_count = 0<br />
    begin<br />
        do facebook crap<br />
    rescue TimeoutError<br />
        if (retry_count &lt; 5)<br />
           retry_count+=1<br />
        end<br />
    end<br />
end<br />
</pre><br />
<br />
Now we are watching it closely to see exactly how it helps us, if at all.</p>

  	  <p>Everyone wants to be a big bad rock star entrepreneur, wake up to that morning when your bank account is flooded by plain cold cash, you are making millions while sitting at home and watching the download meter of your software or user count of your web site flying sky high every day.<br />
Well, it&#8217;s possible, many people have done that, and the nice thing about the web/internet world, is that there will be always, always, enough to share.<br />
But it&#8217;s a long way, and as the nature of things that take long, they tend to break our spirit, get us bored and insecure and afraid of competition.<br />
I have gathered around a few misconceptions about startups and entrepreneurship, misconceptions that most people around this business seems to posses, but those who won&#8217;t, these are the ones who break forward.<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #1 &#8211; &#8220;Fast, Fast, Fast&#8221;</b><br />
Well, shortly.. NO!<br />
Nothing is more important than keeping your startup organized, Clear and planned ahead. Programming fast does not guarantee a better product, Designing, looking around a bit and gathering the baseline on which your consist your product, does guarantee a better product.<br />
Get yourself a clear milestone plan, point out Alpha version (Standalone <span class="caps">POC</span>), private beta (for users you self pick) and a public beta, and stick with this plan!.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #2 &#8211; &#8220;We&#8217;ll grow with it&#8221;</b><br />
Scaling&#8230; people seem to forget about it, more like avoid it until the &#8220;twitter/dzone/digg affect&#8221; hit&#8217;s their home page.<br />
Web application tend to collect more users in a period of time than a downloaded software, web applications are also a single point of service (in case of SaaS), so you&#8217;d better get your system infrastructure ready and available for a user boost one day or another, viral marketing can be a dangerous thing.<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #3 &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough&#8221;</b><br />
i&#8217;ve heard people say &#8220;if this project doesn&#8217;t go public in 5 months, i am out&#8221; or &#8220;i can&#8217;t work with this people, i&#8217;m out&#8221;. There&#8217;s a word for people like that.<br />
quitters.<br />
and quitters don&#8217;t get rich.<br />
The people you work with may be annoying as hell, stupid as hell or useless as hell, if you truly believe in the concept of the idea, don&#8217;t let anyone else&#8217;s negligence to take what is yours and do everything you can (and you <span class="caps">ALWAYS</span> can) to get the startup up and running.<br />
<br />
<b>Misconception #4 &#8211; &#8220;We need more money&#8221;</b><br />
Sometimes you do, sometimes you don&#8217;t.<br />
In order to get a website up and running these days, ready and eager to handle thousands of users, you only need <span class="caps">AWS</span>, which if you exaggerate like hell with your configuration, you&#8217;ll get to 1000$ a month.<br />
So following my previous post, you should know that one or more of your partners must be able to supply you with technical solutions (system administration, coding) so this should almost never be counted as an expense.<br />
Most of the most successful startups were not founded, ever. keep that in mind.</p>

  	  <p>Through the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been working on a facebook application, one of this year&#8217;s todo list items, with my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/liors">Lior Levin</a>.<br />
Well, it&#8217;s been hell.<br />
Not because of Lior :), but becasue of Facebook&#8217;s horrible horrible <span class="caps">API</span>, i haven&#8217;t seen such a bad <span class="caps">API</span> implementation since working on a <a href="http://www.tranzila.com/english.html">Tranzila</a> Credit card gateway in Israel, two years ago.<br />
The facebook api and the entire application-programming-guidelines are idiotic, they offer the support of iFrame applications.<br />
&#8220;good, actually great&#8221; you think.. &#8220;at least i woun&#8217;t have to use the crappy <span class="caps">FBML</span> mishmash thingie&#8230; and i can use JQuery!&#8221; &#8211; But you are wrong, although all of these things are true, using the iFrame interface you are not touching any <span class="caps">FBML</span> crap and can use any JS Framework you&#8217;d like, but the horrors&#8230; the horrors.<br />
First of all, each applications must have a set of callbacks assigned in the application&#8217;s setting page: callback for application main gate, post authorization, post remove and another thing that doesn&#8217;t matter now.<br />
No RESTful web service support what so ever, except for the main application page, all other callbacks are POSTs, what&#8217;s the problem?<br />
When being a loyal Rails developer, you&#8217;d use RESTful routes almost by default, it&#8217;s just right, but what do you do when Facebook decides that user removal actions should be POSTed and not DELETEd? you fuck up your routes.rb to match that, great.<br />
The iFrame is a whole different story, if a user is yet to add your application, he will be redirected to an &#8220;Allow application to do this and that&#8221; page, what&#8217;s the problem? that the redirection happend <span class="caps">WITHIN</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">IFRAME</span>! which basically now causes the user to see a double facebook top bar from that moment until he refreshes the entire screen.<br />
Crap.<br />
It took me a while but i found a way passed it by flagging the first time a user comes in, and JS redirect the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cpurs2">top</a> document to an hard coded application url.<br />
<br />
In this whole mess there was a single light in the end of the tunnel, which is the <a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">Facebooker plugin</a>, which work great but it&#8217;s documentation and online tutorial basically suck.<br />
Maybe i&#8217;ll do a new one&#8230; <br />
done.</p>

  	</div>
  	
  	<div class="entrybody">
  	  <p>I&#8217;ve been involved in several startup projects lately. I the majority of them, one of the main reasons why founders and equity owners start to fight one another, is the moment in which someone thinks some equity needs to be shared with someone else, out side the current equity holders circle.<br />
<br />
Well, nobody likes to give out equity and it&#8217;s hard to know when and tho whom such company/project holdings should be granted.<br />
The option of giving out equity, is mostly driven by the fact the founders need money to make their idea come to life, money or an equivalent needed resource (advisers, tech people). When there is no money, you need to ask yourself one question.<br />
<quote>Do i <span class="caps">REAALLLY</span> need it?</quote>.<br />
They say that holding 100% of 0, is 0.. and they are right, if you will hold your equity holdings close to the chest and refuse to share no matter what, you&#8217;ll probably heading straight down the hill. But on the other hand, giving out equity for anyone who wants some, or giving unreasonable amounts for that matter, is same as bad.<br />
<br />
You can&#8217;t do anything by yourself, you have to share your idea with some other people (unless you are really something special).<br />
The first time you share your project equity with the other founders is simple and easy, most of the time the equity will be divided equally (and it doesn&#8217;t matter who brought the idea, it&#8217;s irrelevant) among the founders, stated in a partnership agreement later to be replaced by and incorporated entity legal documents.<br />
<br />
Now when it gets to expanding the circle, there are two kinds of entrepreneurs that i can across with:<br />
<ol><li><b>Hard<i></i></b> &#8211; These guys are either possessed with a too-high-self-confidence and sure that they can make it to the finish line without sharing a 0.1% with anyone else except for the initial founder circle or people with a wise project-wide view of things and insists of not giving away equity until it&#8217;s absolutely necessary. He believe that any problem can be solved either by finding other forms of getting the required service/resource and will do whatever necessary in order to make things work out without having to release equity or unnecessary funds.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to distinct between these two sides of the Hard Core entrepreneur, but if you have the second kind of person in your team, you are a winner.</li><br />
<li><b>Soft<i></i></b> &#8211; The soft entrepreneur is the the person who will be willing to give away anything for a little help. They will prefer to give away equity as much as possible like hot buns when it&#8217;s not necessary and not required.</li><br />
<li><b>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care&#8221;<i></i></b> &#8211; people who prefer not to take a stand, and will leave everything in the hands of other founder or all the others together. While this can be very useful when he goes your way, it&#8217;s a problem when he&#8217;s not.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<p></ol><b>So how you make the decision?</b><br />
I don&#8217;t believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/workplace_democracy">workplace democracy</a>, not all the time. <b>Sharing equity should be unanimously passed if it is taken in a vote matter</b>, or by a single responsible position holder (<span class="caps">CEO</span> for ex.).<br />
Each one of the initial founders holds his share for a reason, he earned by contibuting to the success of the project and therefore should not be downsized unless he agrees.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are not giving out equity to whoever comes your path, this list of people you should consider giving equaty to in exchage to their services.<br />
<ul><li>External <span class="caps">CEO</span> &#8211; You know how to program and design, but you don&#8217;t know nothing about the business world and need someone else to guide your project to success. An external <span class="caps">CEO</span> is a good solution for that as long as he really understands what your idea is all about, what rarely happen.<br />
Nobody knows your product better than you or your fellow founders for my opinion, but if you need a <span class="caps">CEO</span>, grant out about 10-12%.</li><br />
<li>Venture Capital Firm &#8211; The start-up Messiah, will generally have their own demands but it will move around 20%-60%.</li><br />
<li>Strategic Investment &#8211; Someone who has the capabilities to bring your product to your desired market, audience and exposure. Depends on what he can give you, the appropriate share for such a service is 13-17%.</li><br />
<li>Angel &#8211; A small financial investment that it&#8217;s entire purpose is to get things running. 10%-15% is enough, but note that if it&#8217;s a first financial investment, it&#8217;s also sets your company value. (10% for 25K, brings your company to a 250,000 value, and your share grows as well.</li><br />
<li>Tech Services &#8211; If you are going for a tech related project, such as a website or a software, <b>make sure the other founders can supply as much as possible from the project&#8217;s technical requirements</b>, if you didn&#8217;t (bad) and still need these services, grant about 0.2% for a programmer and 3%-4% for a team leader.<br /></p>
</li>
<p></ul>Kinds of people that should never get an equity share are: lawyers, advisers, sales persons and such.<br />
Keep in mind that anything that can wait, should wait and the Internet is a pretty big place for you to find what this people will probably charge 100$ an hour to tell you.<br />
When you do need a lawyer or counseling, pay the money and that&#8217;s it, no equity for counseling.<br />
<br />
Last thing, keep in mind that there are wolves out there, people who seek to only find young, naive entrepreneur to which they can sell any dreams they want.<br />
Consider every offer, but make the most to avoid sharing if you can, and if you do, share as little as possible.</p>
