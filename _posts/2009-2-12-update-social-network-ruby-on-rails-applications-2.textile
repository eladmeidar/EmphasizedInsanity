One of my current consulting positions, involves a startup company with a great idea and a great social network implementation idea.<br />
For that matter, i have been scavenging the web lately for Rails based social netowrking plugins, Engines or maybe even a skeleton application for those guys and i found some very good solution apps and infrastructures, the only problem rails Rails 2.0 compatibility (which i didn't check yet, and some don't indicate) and Documentation, which seem to be neglected on almost all those apps.<br />
<br />
So, Here's the current list:<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://lovdbyless.com/">LovdByLess</a></span></b><br />
include blogs, user profiles, photo uploads, forums, friendships and user-to-user messaging funcionallity.<br />
Looks great and has a great look and feel.<br />
Comes as a full application under MIT license.<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.communityengine.org/">CommunityEngine</a></b></span><br />
A <a href="http://rails-engines.org/">Rails engine</a>, now supports Rails 2.0.<br />
Gives you the basic functionality for a social networking site. It includes features such as User pages, forums, uploads, geo searches, blogging and more.<br />
Important to say that extending the basic engine with your own controllers and models, is supposed to be easy and simple, i am currently testing it out so i don't really have an opinion yet.<br />
Documentation has to be improved though, a lot.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://www.toghq.com/">TOG</a></b></span>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/toghq/tog-business-535002">presentation</a><br />
TOG is basically a package of features (in the form of plugins) which you can choose to add to your applications as one, or as a whole.<br />
<quote>Using these prepackaged and automated features should let you focus on the real key point about social networks: keep the conversation going with your members. If you’re just starting a social site or wants to polish your community with lovely social capabilities maybe you should give tog a try.</quote><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://portal.insoshi.com/">Insoshi</a></b></span><br />
