* "Serve: A Rapid Prototyping Framework For Designers":http://wiseheartdesign.com/2009/4/21/reintroducing-serve-a-rapid-prototyping-framework-for-designers/ - That looks nice, pretty much a webrick instance that runs in ANY folder you want.
* "HTTP request tracking tools":http://ajaxian.com/archives/common-http-tracing-export-format - Tracking your HTTP requests is useful when you want to make sure you are getting/sending the right headers, or when you test CSRF attacks.
* "Selenium + JQuery":http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/TelluriumjQuerySelector - Although falling off the train recently, i really like selenium and this new enhancement binds it with JQuery in order to make dom traversing faster.
* "CSS vertical-align attribute":http://css-tricks.com/what-is-vertical-align/ - win, Chris is THE MEN.
* "Showing links when hovering over a Paragraph":http://www.marcofolio.net/css/showing_links_while_hovering_using_css.html - Win, i like this approach of showing links only when the user is in focus, like when hovering over a table row or a relevant paragraph.
* "Debugging Rails with Rack":http://themomorohoax.com/2009/04/20/debugging-rails-2-3-2-apps-with-rack-bug - Awesome.  
* "Non-SQL databases overview":http://00f.net/2009/an-overview-of-modern-sql-free-databases - Weird, freaky, attractive. :)
* "The paris hilton approach to web development":http://www.codesqueeze.com/the-paris-hilton-approach-to-software-development/ - Funny as hell.
