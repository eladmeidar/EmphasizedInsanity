I finished my post before reading theirs and didn&#8217;t add things Koz wrote and i didn&#8217;t,&nbsp; so don&#8217;t blame me in stealing or something. :)</div><p>Some noob at #rubyonrails (irc.freenode.net) asked a question a few days ago about some issue he had while <b>storing uploaded files as BLOBs in his database</b>.<br />
I Know storing files in a database is usually a bad idea, but i still thought about the face that i was yet to see a propar guidance on how to handle files (using the correct practices of course).<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-size: large;">Plugins</span></b><br />
<a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/24">Attachement_fu</a> &#8211; The older brother, pretty nice, better than the late file_column.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://jimneath.org/2008/04/17/paperclip-attaching-files-in-rails/">PaperClip</a> &#8211; An &#8220;updated&#8221; attachement_fu, some people say it&#8217;s better than attachement_fu because it is actually working. There is a lot more work being done on this plugin now a days, so it&#8217;s better to relay on it rather than on attachment_fu.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-size: large;">Storing your files.<br />
</span></b><br />
<b>Local File System</b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">This option can only work out for you, if you are running your app on a single server, simply set one of the plugins to store the uploaded files whereever you want, and that&#8217;s it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">You can also setup a network folder if you&#8217;d like and imitate a local folder across a number of servers, but i&#8217;s the same. <br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">What you do need to be careful from, is a situation where you are saving too many files into a single folder, which will cause mainly for a slow file lookup.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Try to refine you directory structures for your upload root in order to avoid such a problem.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><b>Amazon S3</b></span><br />
The main reasons to use Amazon S3 are that it&#8217;s amazingly scalable and incrediably cheap. Other than that it&#8217;s pretty easy to manage using the plugins or some gems around there, and it&#8217;s generally offloading the weight of sending files to your users an keeping your application servers busy (i wrote before on <a href="http://blog.eizesus.com/2008/07/apache-x-sendfile-in-rails.html">apache&#8217;s x-sendfile</a> header, that&#8217;s another way).<br />
<br />
<b>and&#8230; still.. BLOBs</b><br />
As i said before, i am not a fan of storing files in your db, seems like out of context for me, but some people like it.<br />
If you insist (<a href="http://mysqldump.azundris.com/archives/36-Serving-Images-From-A-Database.html">and you shouldn&#8217;t</a>) , you&#8217;ll need to setup a <a href="http://rpheath.com/posts/52-rails-migrations-for-blobs">proper migration</a> to handle BLOBs, and the rest is up to you.</p>
