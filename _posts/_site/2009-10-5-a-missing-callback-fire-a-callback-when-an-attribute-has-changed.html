<p>Rails callbacks are awesome, it&#8217;s probably the most magical piece of code (aside from the demonic initializer) that i have seen in the source and we all use it in our controllers and models to enforce some <span class="caps">DRY</span> code and conventions over your application.</p>
<p>Lately, i came into realize, that there might be a missing callback in Rails. an <code>when_attribute_changed</code> callback that fires when you change an attribute.<br />
Thanks to the <code>ActiveRecord::Dirty</code> magic, it&#8217;s very easy to be aware of where and when an attribute was changed and maybe try to wrap that out, but i was looking for something more accurate that wouldn&#8217;t require me to invoke <code>changed?</code> on every attribute.</p>
<p>So after digging a while in the Rails source code (Thanks to the <a href="http://wiki.railsbridge.org/projects/railsbridge/wiki/BugMash">Bugmash</a>, it&#8217;s pretty easy to navigate through nowadays), i found that he base attribute handling is done with the write_attribute method so you should be ear-dropping into it.</p>
<p>This is a module that binds the <code>attribute_changed</code> custom callback and fires it off on when an attribute is changed. The default method that handles this exception is named <code>flag_attribute_changed</code>, but you can overwrite it as you like</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/201879.js"></script><p>although this is a nice roundup, i still haven&#8217;t found a way to restrict it to apply only on specific attributes. open to ideas.</p>
