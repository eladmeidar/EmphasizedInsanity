<p>Few people understand the true mentality of dealing with a Boolean variable.<br />The normal programmer will panic, and immediately attempt to compare it to a Boolean constant.<br /><br />when using Rails, This is wrong.<br /><br />When migrating a boolean typed column using Rails, the actual column type created is &#8220;tinyint(1)&#8221; (a single digit number presentation which means that the actual value being saved is 0&#8217;s or 1&#8217;s.<br />Where is the problem? in Ruby for a change.<br />In Ruby, everything except <strong>nil</strong> and <strong>false</strong> is considered to a true value. In C, Python and many other languages, 0 and possibly other values, such as empty lists, are considered as false.<br /><br />which brings us to the inevitable conclusion, that simplay comparing boolean values to  <span style="font-weight: bold;">true</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">false</span> will not do.<br /><br />Rails solves this tiny issue for us, for each boolean attribute, Rails implements a &#8220;query method&#8221; as i prefer to call them. These query methods are simply called by issuing the boolean attribute name with a &#8220;?&#8221; suffix.<br /><br />for example, the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><code>mail_message&lt;/span&gt; instance object has a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;is_important&lt;/span&gt; boolean attribute, so instead of doing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</code>mail_message.is_important == true<br /></code><br />or whatever, we can simply ask rails by:<br /><code>&lt;br /&gt;@mail_message.is_important?&lt;br /&gt;</code><br /><br />beautiful&#8230; isn&#8217;t it?</p>
