<p></ul><br />
Looking back, it wasn&#8217;t such a bad year&#8230; some things may not be so good, but i believe that 2009 is the key year for me.<br />
Hopefully in the next year (on Mephisto!!), i will be able to say<br />
&#8220;it was an amazing year&#8221;<br />
<br />
happy new year everyone.</p>
