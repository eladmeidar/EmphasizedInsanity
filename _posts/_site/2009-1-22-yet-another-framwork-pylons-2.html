<quote>Pylons combines the very best ideas from the worlds of Ruby, Python and Perl, providing a structured but extremely flexible Python web framework. It&#8217;s also one of the first projects to leverage the emerging <span class="caps">WSGI</span> standard, which allows extensive re-use and flexibility — but only if you need it. Out of the box, Pylons aims to make web development fast, flexible and easy</quote><p><br />

Looks like a fun language, after reading the <a href="http://pylonsbook.com/">Pylon book</a> for a few days now, it looks very interesting.<br />
<br />
This framework is based on Paste and allows some extended python usage, templating, modeling and basically a full <span class="caps">MVC</span> application development interface (even CouchDB).<br />
<br />
What i can say about it, is that it&#8217;s some kind of another Rails-ish framwork (&#8220;paster&#8221; for &#8220;generate&#8221; for example), these frameworks are popping like mushrooms these days (Currently reviewing the <span class="caps">PHP</span> Akelos framework as well)<br />
