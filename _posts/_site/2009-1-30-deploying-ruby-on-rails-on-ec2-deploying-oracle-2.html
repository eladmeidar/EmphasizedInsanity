<p>Well, generally i use Oracle for my large scale applications.<br />
Some people might say that it&#8217;s not too-competible with Rails, but using the <a href="http://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced/tree/master">oracle_enhanced_adapter</a> didn&#8217;t pop up any special issues (it even supports Oracle&#8217;s bind variables technique).<br />
The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/cloud/index.html?rssid=rss_otn_news">Oracle Cloud Deployment tutorials</a> on Oracle&#8217;s website contains explanations, PDFs, tutorials and demos on how and when to deploy Oracle DB in the cloud.<br />
Extra guides include backup and recovery practices.</p>
