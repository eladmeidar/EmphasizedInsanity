<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>For a while iv&#8217;e been trying to find a better way to post my blog posts, other than simply go into the <a href='http://draft.blogger.com'>Blogger Dashboard</a>.<br/>Iv&#8217;e tried several Mac clients (MarsEdit, Ecto) and none of them succeeded in working with my blog (probably a template issue, not resolved yet).<br/>A few days ago i came across this <a href='http://www.scribefire.com'>Blogging firefox extention called ScribeFire</a>, which appears to be the ultimate solution.<br/>ScribeFire supports multiple blog platforms, <span class="caps">HTML</span> editing and even an embedded ads service (didn&#8217;t try it though).<br/><br/></div>
