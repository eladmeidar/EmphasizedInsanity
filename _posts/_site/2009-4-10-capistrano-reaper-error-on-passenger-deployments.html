<p>Capistrano 2&#8217;s <code>deploy:restart</code> is still back in the past, where Mongrel clusters still ruled the earth and were the best way to deploy rails.<br />
When dealing with mongrel clusters, Capistrano tries to restart your mongrel processes by issuing the <code>/script/process/reaper</code> script or the spinner script.<br />
Passenger doesn&#8217;t do that anymore, you restart your Passenger application servers by simply issuing the a <code>touch tmp/restart.txt</code> in your project root.</p>
<p>But, Capistrano still tries to run reaper (which you don&#8217;t setup and don&#8217;t even touch when you run Passenger deployments) and encounters an error every time you deploy.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
 ** transaction: commit
  * executing `deploy:restart'
  * executing "sudo -p 'sudo password: ' -u app /var/www/twitterooms/current/script/process/reaper"
    servers: [""]

*** [err :: ] sudo: no passwd entry for app!
    command finished

</pre>
<p><strong>Yeah, the error is unrelated in this case, too lazy to fix that too.. since i don&#8217;t care about reaper processes anyway</strong></p>
<p>The fix is to simply <strong>override the :restart capistrano task</strong> just like that:</p>
<pre class="brush: ruby">
# In ur deploy.rb
deploy.task :restart, :roles =&gt; :app do
  run "touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt"
end
</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>
