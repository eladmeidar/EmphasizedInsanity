<p>The apache <code>rewrite</code> engine is pretty cool, it allows you handle the user&#8217;s request and preform actions (redirect, block&#8230;) according to a pattern given as parameter.<br />
This main use for rewrites i guess, is to enable pretty <span class="caps">URL</span> outside your app, or to support legacy conventions. (Like i should have done here when i moved to mephisto).</p>
