<p>A new version for the <a href="http://blog.rayapps.com/2009/03/23/activerecord-oracle-enhanced-adapter-also-on-jruby-and-ruby-19/">oracle_enhanced_adapter is now out</a>, which is exciting for those of use who chose to work with Oracle.<br />
Use can use the Oracle enhanced adapter:</p>
<ul>
	<li>on <span class="caps">MRI</span> 1.8.6 with ruby-oci8 1.0.x library or gem</li>
	<li>on JRuby (so far tested with 1.1.6) with <span class="caps">JDBC</span> Oracle driver</li>
	<li>on Ruby/<span class="caps">YARV</span> 1.9.1 with ruby-oci8 2.0 library or gem</li>
</ul>
<p>And, which is the coolest, <strong>Oracle enhanced adapter passes 100% ActiveRecord unit tests!</strong></p>
<p>install the new adapter by:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash"><br />
$ sudo gem install activerecord-oracle_enahnced-adapter<br />
</pre></p>
<p><strong>note that some of the <span class="caps">SQL</span> compatible with Mysql and is used by rails, is not compatible with Oracle</strong>, so run your tests again.</p>
