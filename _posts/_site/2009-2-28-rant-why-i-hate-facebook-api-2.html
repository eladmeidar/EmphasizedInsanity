<p>Through the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been working on a facebook application, one of this year&#8217;s todo list items, with my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/liors">Lior Levin</a>.<br />
Well, it&#8217;s been hell.<br />
Not because of Lior :), but becasue of Facebook&#8217;s horrible horrible <span class="caps">API</span>, i haven&#8217;t seen such a bad <span class="caps">API</span> implementation since working on a <a href="http://www.tranzila.com/english.html">Tranzila</a> Credit card gateway in Israel, two years ago.<br />
The facebook api and the entire application-programming-guidelines are idiotic, they offer the support of iFrame applications.<br />
&#8220;good, actually great&#8221; you think.. &#8220;at least i woun&#8217;t have to use the crappy <span class="caps">FBML</span> mishmash thingie&#8230; and i can use JQuery!&#8221; &#8211; But you are wrong, although all of these things are true, using the iFrame interface you are not touching any <span class="caps">FBML</span> crap and can use any JS Framework you&#8217;d like, but the horrors&#8230; the horrors.<br />
First of all, each applications must have a set of callbacks assigned in the application&#8217;s setting page: callback for application main gate, post authorization, post remove and another thing that doesn&#8217;t matter now.<br />
No RESTful web service support what so ever, except for the main application page, all other callbacks are POSTs, what&#8217;s the problem?<br />
When being a loyal Rails developer, you&#8217;d use RESTful routes almost by default, it&#8217;s just right, but what do you do when Facebook decides that user removal actions should be POSTed and not DELETEd? you fuck up your routes.rb to match that, great.<br />
The iFrame is a whole different story, if a user is yet to add your application, he will be redirected to an &#8220;Allow application to do this and that&#8221; page, what&#8217;s the problem? that the redirection happend <span class="caps">WITHIN</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">IFRAME</span>! which basically now causes the user to see a double facebook top bar from that moment until he refreshes the entire screen.<br />
Crap.<br />
It took me a while but i found a way passed it by flagging the first time a user comes in, and JS redirect the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cpurs2">top</a> document to an hard coded application url.<br />
<br />
In this whole mess there was a single light in the end of the tunnel, which is the <a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">Facebooker plugin</a>, which work great but it&#8217;s documentation and online tutorial basically suck.<br />
Maybe i&#8217;ll do a new one&#8230; <br />
done.</p>
