<p>Single Table inheritance. Lot&#8217;s of developers i talk to seem to hate the concept of <span class="caps">STI</span> and claim that it&#8217;s  &#8220;java-ish&#8221; and something that should be avoided on all costs.<br />
Generally i would spend me time explaining to that person why <span class="caps">STI</span> is a legitimate design pattern which can be useful and correct when being used in the right place and not as a &#8220;super solution for everything&#8221;, but a recent post named <a href="http://www.matthewpaulmoore.com/articles/1276-ruby-on-rails-code-quality-checklist">The Rails Code Quality Checklist</a> recently bashed <span class="caps">STI</span> and surprisingly (imo, at least) got pretty good responses from people around.</p>
<p>Any case of a misused design pattern can be tagged as a &#8220;bad practice&#8221;, and the one to blame for it is usually the developer/programmer, and not the design pattern. I thought i might take a swing at this mayhem and maybe try to clear out some stuff about <span class="caps">STI</span> and best usage practices in rails:</p>
<h3>Using <span class="caps">STI</span></h3>
<p><span class="caps">STI</span> is a design pattern that is aimed to allow multiple <span class="caps">ORM</span> classes to share the same database table in case they share a large base of common attributes (columns) and to represent an inheritance functionality in a relational <span class="caps">DBMS</span>. The main plus of this design pattern is that you don&#8217;t have to create several tables that have common columns, you just use a single table to host all your models and by that, DRYing up your database infrastructure.</p>
<h4>Good example</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a `Cat` and a `Lion` classes. It would make perfect sense to use a single table inheritance in this case since we all (should) know that a lion is a kind of a cat.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/212197.js"></script><p>Since there is almost a complete overlapping between those 2 models&#8217; attributes (although they still differ in concept and may have different methods), it will be a smart choice to use <span class="caps">STI</span> in this case.</p>
<h4>Bad example</h4>
<p>This is a bad example of an <span class="caps">STI</span> implementation:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/212210.js"></script><p>Although Cat and Human can both be considered as Animals, they overlap each other in a very small number of attirbutes. As you can see `highschool_name` and `married_since` are both attributes that has no meaning when we are referring to a Cat instance, on the other hand `last_visit_at_the_vet` and `fur_color` are useless to a Human instance. Those attributes, although unnecessary, are also populated when you access the table.</p>
<p>If you have too many of those unnecessary fields, this may lead to bulky queries and lousy database performance, and of course, blaming <span class="caps">STI</span>.</p>
<h5>Stuff to pay attention to and countermeasures to take</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Every time you think about creating an <span class="caps">STI</span> implementation or adding a column to an <span class="caps">STI</span> parent table, <strong>check that the amount of fields that don&#8217;t apply to all of the children classes, is relatively small or zero</strong>.</li>
	<li>Add indexes, usually for an <span class="caps">STI</span> table you&#8217;ll need to add an joint index on both `:id` and your inheritance column name (defaults to `:type`). You can use my <a href="http://github.com/eladmeidar/rails_indexes">RailsIndexes</a> plugin to see if there are other places you may need to add indexes in.</li>
	<li>If your <span class="caps">STI</span> table is going to host a big/huge amount of data, indexes may not be enough. Using memcached, Sphinx, cassandra or any other memory resident storage might boost your application performance.</li>
	<li>pay attention to your design, don&#8217;t treat any kind of inheritance as an <span class="caps">STI</span> implementation de-facto, consider the fact and the other players in your infrastructure to maximize the relevancy of your decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course both of my examples could have been solved easily in other ways as you suggests (if one prefers that).</p>
<p>Point is, that <span class="caps">STI</span> is not more &#8220;evil&#8221; than overusing plugins, super-sized controllers, no cacheing or no testing. It&#8217;s yet another thing you need to know when and how to use.</p>
