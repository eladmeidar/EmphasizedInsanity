<p>when you use rails&#8217;s image_tag, by default it sets the <span class="caps">HTML</span> attributes of alt and title to the filename of the image. so for<br /><code>&lt;br /&gt;image_tag 'dscn0001.jpg'&lt;br /&gt;</code><br />will produce the following html something like that<br /><code>&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;img src="images/dscn0001.jpg" alt="dscn0001" /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;</code><br /><br />the alt attribute for image tag is meant to explain the content of the image in case the actual image was not found, or for non-graphic browsers.<br /><br />The default value for the alt attribute should not be used, unless the file name does not really supply information about the image. my suggestion is to use the :alt option in the image_tag helper.<br /><br />important: do not attempt to use the alt for keywords heaping (&#8216;elad-rails-blog-ruby.jpg&#8217;), this will not help you in your <span class="caps">SEO</span>.</p>
