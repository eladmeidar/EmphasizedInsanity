<p>I don&#8217;t think that there is something more annoying, disgusting, blood vessel popping in a web developer life, than browser testing.<br />
Leave a side the already known rants, about IE being hell on desktop, and that nothing is working as you expect on all browsers, there&#8217;s also the issue <strong>of getting all these browsers</strong> to even get the test results.</p>
<p>To test on Safari, you need a Mac access (no, safari for windows is <span class="caps">NOT</span> a browser) and if you are working on a mac, you&#8217;ll need to dual boot windows or install a VM in order to get a convenient access to IE and it&#8217;s minions.</p>
<p>Well no more, <a href="http://litmusapp.com/alkaline/">Alkaline</a> allows you to get a clean sweep access to 17 browsers, directly on your mac.<br />
It sounds great, but the down side is that it&#8217;s not free and have a <strong>subscription licensing</strong> (per month, per day). it might be a cool idea and a nice initiative, but when <a href="http://browsershots.org/">BrowserShots.org</a> is out there, it is much less attractive.</p>
