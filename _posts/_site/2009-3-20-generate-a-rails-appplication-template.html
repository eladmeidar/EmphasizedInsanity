<p>I fear the rails community is getting closer and closer to fulfill my vision of <code>acts_as_what_i_want</code>plugin.<br />
<a href="http://www.youvegotrails.com/">YouveGotRails.com</a> allows one to generate a rails application with plugins and gems of choice, along side some extra configuration options (Git and Capistrano Initialization).</p>
<p>Nice, useful?</p>
