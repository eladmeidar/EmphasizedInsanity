<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> #1:</strong> Apparently, the <code>response.body</code> is truncated sometimes so the <span class="caps">JSON</span> parser fails, what&#8217;s ever weirder is that once ever few refreshes (going back to my authentication page on my app and trying again), it&#8217;s not truncated and the authentication is successful.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> #2:</strong> Well, after debugging some more, it appeared to be that the response <strong>arrived truncated</strong> from twitter, obviously i had nothing to do with it but to rant, so i decided to go to bed.<br />
Now, 7 hours later it seems like all is ok and the response is valid and complete.</p>
<h4><span class="caps">ORIGINAL</span> <span class="caps">POST</span></h4>
<p>Twitter recently added a new feature, they decided to require the end user to enter a pin number to approve desktop applications in order to keep away spoofed messages.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s a nice idea if they were kind enough to help the programmers out and not make things complicated.<br />
When you setup your application, you can determine whether your app is a Desktop or a Web app, and the new <span class="caps">PIN</span> feature should impact only desktop apps as they say.</p>
<p>But, when you try to authenticate (OAuth) it seems like that they treat your application as a desktop app *if you include an oauth_callback parameter in your authentication <span class="caps">GET</span> request&quot;.</p>
<p>The fix for that is pretty simple, remove the &#8220;oauth_callback&#8221; parameter from your <code>twitter_auth.yml</code> and add the following fix to prevent the OAuth gem from including a default <code>oauth_callback</code> parameter into your requests.</p>
<pre class="brush: ruby">
OAuth::Consumer.class_eval do
  def get_request_token(request_options = {}, *arguments)
    response = token_request(http_method, (request_token_url? ?
request_token_url : request_token_path), nil, request_options,
*arguments)
    OAuth::RequestToken.from_hash(self, response)
  end
end 
</pre>
<p>Now twitter recognises your app as a web app (as it should already).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still wrong, when twitter redirects back to your app, it sends what appears to be a hash containing the logged in user info in a <span class="caps">JSON</span> format. but for some reason on the <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth/blob/b64af9689ea4a5c0d1695f5ef15131cdcb69fb64/lib/twitter_auth/dispatcher/shared.rb#L26">OAuth shared.rb file</a> the <code>JSON.parse</code> call raises a ParseError 618 (whatever that means) when trying to parse the user info hash.</p>
<p>This error basically causes (as you can see in the code) to pass on the plain text <code>response.body</code> and eventually raise an error in <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth/blob/b64af9689ea4a5c0d1695f5ef15131cdcb69fb64/app/models/twitter_auth/generic_user.rb#L39">here</a> when it assumes an hash was passed in (but its a plain string) (NoMethod key? for String).</p>
<p>I am totally hopeless as of this moment, <a href="http://twitter.com/mbleigh">@mbleigh</a>, the awesome author of the twitter_auth plugin said he&#8217;ll be working on it soon, hopefully he&#8217;ll come to the rescue soon.</p>
