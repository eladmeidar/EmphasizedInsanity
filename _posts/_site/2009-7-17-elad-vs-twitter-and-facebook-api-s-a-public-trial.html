<h4>I call Facebook <span class="caps">API</span> for the stand&#8230;.</h4>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;Mr. FB, since the night of the 1st of January 2009, Has Mr. Meidar made any attempt of requesting some &#8216;out of line&#8217; requests?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;No, absolutely not. he&#8217;s entire wish was to integrate a very basic set of my <span class="caps">API</span> interface.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;So why did you fail to comply with those requests?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;Well, there are many reasons&#8230; sometimes Mr. Meidar was simply requesting it wrong&#8230; i&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s because my documentation suck, there are too many contradictions within it, and that the most of the online reference, is basically in <span class="caps">PHP</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;And how Mr. Meidar was finally able to communicate with you?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;I believe Mr. Meidar chose the common Rails plugin named <a href="http://github.com/mmangino/facebooker/tree/master">Facebooker</a> in order to communicate with me. I do know that he had to patch it like a demented tailor in order to make it work more efficiently.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;..i believe it was not the first attempt of Mr. Meidar to communicate with you..&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;Yes, Meidar previously tried to create a native iFrame Facebook application, which the Facebooker plugin facebook session management, fails to serve.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;Can you tell us about your relationship with Mr. Meidar&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;Mr. Meidar is relentless, he never gives up. no matter how much i pissed him off&#8230;. i rejected <span class="caps">API</span> calls with no reason, returns vogue error messages (not enough memory, my favorite), refused to render <span class="caps">FBML</span> and <span class="caps">XFBML</span> tags&#8230; and when i did reply, it was in an unbelievably slow response times&#8230;. he just didn&#8217;t gave up.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;Can you give us an example?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;Yeah, one time Mr. Meidar tried to request some information about a user&#8217;s friends, when he tried to run the <span class="caps">FQL</span> query for a user with 3000+ friends, i returned him a vogue response of (out of memory). he should feel lucky, i did that for much smaller requests!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;How did he finally break through?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &quot;Well, he basically changed a lot of the Facebooker code to match his requirements, mostly by changing most of the <span class="caps">API</span> functions to use <span class="caps">FQL</span> instead of the <span class="caps">API</span> interface. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;So what you are basically saying&#8230;..is that it&#8217;s Facebooker&#8217;s fault?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;It&#8217;s about 50/50, i am the crappiest <span class="caps">API</span> out there, and my documentation is about as helpful to developers as a russian shuttle manual would, but the Facebooker plugin is far from being perfect too&#8230; very far.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Q: &#8220;You recommend other Rails developers to use the Facebooker plugin?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>A: &#8220;Well, yes and no&#8230; there isn&#8217;t a real replacement, and Facebooker is maintained and updated pretty much regularly, but i would recommend that anyone who wishes to integrate my services, will do it with Facebook Connect and query for information using my <span class="caps">FQL</span> engine and keep in mind that the Facebooker code would probably require some tweaks to match their needs.&#8221;</p>
