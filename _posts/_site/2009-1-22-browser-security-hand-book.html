<quote>The Browser Security Handbook is a free and no-nonsense guide to the security concepts in today&#8217;s main browsers. It covers all security features, explains why and in which browsers certain attack methods work and talks about experimental security mechanisms in browsers. It&#8217;s a recommended read for everyone who creates web applications.</quote><p><br />
