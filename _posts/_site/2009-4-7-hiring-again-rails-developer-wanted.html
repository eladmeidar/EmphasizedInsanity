<p>We&#8217;ve been working for a while on our biggest project (Aviation industry related), and it&#8217;s keeping my team busy too much in the past few weeks, and they can&#8217;t seem to reach other tasks.<br />
So, i decided to open a seperate development team to handle this project and i am looking for Rails developers to man it in the near future:</p>
<p><strong>Job Requirements</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Rails 2.x experience (duh!).</li>
	<li>jQuery (mootools too would be nice).</li>
	<li>Since it&#8217;s an in-house job, you should be living around Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</li>
	<li>Proven experience and recommendations would be nice too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Contact me via:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/eladmeidar">Twitter</a>,</li>
	<li>The <code>#rubyonrails</code> <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel on <code>irc.freenode.net</code> as <code>eladmeidar</code>.</li>
	<li>or via my email address at my <a href="http://www.eizesus.com">home page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See ya!</p>
