<p>As you all well know, i am a proud member of new rails community named <a href="http://blog.eizesus.com/2009/5/announcing-railsbridge-com">RailsBridge</a>.</p>
<p>I signed myself up to be responsible of this community main website which basically means i need to</p>
<ol>
	<li>develop it.</li>
	<li>design it.</li>
	<li>maintain it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I gathered up some help around the <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel (<code>#railsbridge</code>) and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge/browse_thread/thread/dc3412fe7a2cd038">Google Group</a> and it&#8217;s going to be fun. :)<br />
But, as fun as it may sound, we do need to get some help doing so from other members of the rails community, So if you feel like helping out in forming a new, cool, fun and professional <a href="http://www.railsbridge.com">community</a>, just let me know on the comments, one <a href="http://twitter.com/eladmeidar">Twitter</a> the &quot;&quot;Google Group&quot;:http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge/ or on the <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel.</p>
