<p>MySQL is a very nice <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> for almost every application, even some of the bigshots use a personally patched version of MySQL to store their data.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a small time application, with not too many hits, your default stock configuration should do. But once you get a little famous and your data flow begins to rise, you may need to tweak your configuration a little bit in order to make you db instance a little faster, and nicer to the guests.</p>
<div id="note">
<p>
<p>Most web developers i know, think that the DB is not as important as it really is and believe they can &#8220;make it work&#8221; good enough by reading a few blog posts and a few tutorials.<br />
Databases are serious business, a bad database infrastructure and implementation may and probably will bring you application down in flames.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Of course you can try to do it yourself for your small/medium size projects and applications, but i <strong>strongly</strong> suggest you&#8217;ll hire a professional <span class="caps">DBA</span> to do the DB related tasks for you, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
</p>
</div>
<h4>Step 1: back-the-fuck-up</h4>
<p>Trust me, there are a lot of things you&#8217;d wish that happened to you instead of a system meltdown when you are staring at one. No matter what you do with your DB configuration files, <strong>always keep a backup copy of your:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Configuration files</li>
	<li>If possible a full data and structure dump (snapshot).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2: Let&#8217;s see what we can work with</h4>
<p><span class="caps">RAM</span>, our long time and often consumed friend. The first thing you have to do when you are tweaking you database, is to check <strong>how much you can tweak it</strong>, you don&#8217;t want your configuration file to contain statements that will leave your application servers with 12MB of <span class="caps">RAM</span> to work with.</p>
<p>In Debian (i don&#8217;t know about the other distros) you can check what is your available <span class="caps">RAM</span> by typing <code>free -m</code>:<br />
<pre class="plain"><br />
root@socialninjaz:/etc/mysql# free -m<br />
              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached<br />
Mem:          1024        627        396          0          3        407<br />
-/+ buffers/cache:        216        807<br />
Swap:         2047        187       1860<br />
</pre></p>
<p>Nice output. The information we are after is on the <code>mem:</code> row, and the <code>free</code> column, this basically says <strong>how many free MBs of <span class="caps">RAM</span> do you have</strong>, write this number down.</p>
<p>Now we want to find out how much memory <strong>MySQL is currently occupying</strong>, we&#8217;ll do that by typing <code>top -d 1 -n 2 -u mysql</code>:<br />
<pre class=" plain"><br />
  <span class="caps">PID</span> <span class="caps">USER</span>      PR  NI  <span class="caps">VIRT</span>  <span class="caps">RES</span>  <span class="caps">SHR</span> S %<span class="caps">CPU</span> %<span class="caps">MEM</span>    TIME+                                                                                                                                                                   <br />
 8144 mysql     20   0  494m 142m 3428 S    0 13.9   1268:58<br />
</pre></p>
<p>We are interested in the number just below the <code>VIRT</code> column. <strong>sum this number with the free mem you got before, and that&#8217;s your available <span class="caps">RAM</span> resources</strong>.</p>
<h4>Tweak-Tweak!, Tweak-Tweak!</h4>
<p>You can find your <code>my.cnf</code> file on Ubuntu in <code>/etc/mysql</code>, assuringly that you <strong><span class="caps">BACKED</span> UP <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">CONFIGURATION</span> <span class="caps">FILE</span></strong> earlier, you can safely edit <code>my.cnf</code>, note that when i used percentage, you should replace it with the percentage from the available memory number you got before:<br />
<pre class="plain"><br />
query_cache_limit=2M<br />
query_cache_size=25%<br />
query_cache_type=1<br />
thread_cache_size=128<br />
key_buffer = 25%<br />
join_buffer = 4M<br />
table_cache=25%<br />
sort_buffer=4M<br />
read_rnd_buffer_size=1%<br />
tmp_table_size=10% (or 32M, whichever is greater)<br />
</pre></p>
<p>Restart your MySQL (<code>/etc/init.d/mysql restart</code>) and watch performance for while, hopefully nothing goes in flames.</p>
<h4>Ok, what did we do?</h4>
<p>We only use about 80% of your free memory using this calculation, we don&#8217;t want to overuse or to starve other processes on the system, <span class="caps">RAM</span> is pretty yummie and everybody wants some. of course there are a lot more parameters to consider, but most of them are application/implementation specific, so you&#8217;ll have to <strong><span class="caps">HIRE</span> A <span class="caps">DBA</span></strong> to finish it up and support your application.</p>
