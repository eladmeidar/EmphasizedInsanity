<p>I am a fan of plain text emails, it&#8217;s usually my default on every email client i am working on in the past couple of years. I despise <span class="caps">HTML</span> both as an E-Mail user and as a developer.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HTML</span> emails are mostly hard to code and design (Inline design, subdued to many rules thanks for Gmail, Outlook and other friends) and personally, i don&#8217;t think it makes a whole lot difference.</p>
<p>But, clients often want shiny emails so you have to do what they want or you&#8217;ll die hungry. Display tables (not <span class="caps">DESGINING</span> by tables) is pretty easy in <span class="caps">HTML</span> emails and works pretty good, but what happens when you want to send a multipart email with both plain text and <span class="caps">HTML</span> version, and try to keep the same design?</p>
<p>you need a plain text table!<br />

<p>those things, yeah.</p>
<p>After searching for a while for a good solution, i found the <a href="http://github.com/visionmedia/terminal-table">terminal-table</a> gem (install via <a href="http://gemcutter.org">GemCutter</a>) that supplies this awesome functionality of creating a textual table, much like <code>faster_csv</code>&#8217;s approach and <span class="caps">DSL</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created a small extension for the Ruby <code>Array</code> class to produce a plain text table from an array of ActiveRecord objects:</p>
