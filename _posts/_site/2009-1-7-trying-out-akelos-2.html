<p><a href="http://www.akelos.org/">Akelos</a> became very intersting after a guy pulled it out of the sleeve in one of my many &#8220;Rails is better&#8221; duals with <span class="caps">PHP</span>/.Net developers.<br />I had no idea at the what he was talking about (shame on me..) so i decided (and promised that guy) to do some work on Akelos a little bit, and than go back and tell him that i still prefer Rails.<br /><br />Well, a little bit about Akelos.<br />Akelos is an <span class="caps">MVC</span> <span class="caps">PHP</span> web development Framework which consists over <span style="font-weight: bold;">favoring convention over configuration</span>, sounds familier?<br />As far as a basic overview and right before starting my first Akelos application, i find it rather a <span class="caps">PHP</span> Rails replica, even with some basic convention naming (has_many? again?) but the basic syntax is still <span class="caps">PHP</span> and consists too much over direct <span class="caps">SQL</span>.<br /><br /><pre>$Project&#8594;findFirstBy(&#8216;language&#8217;, &#8216;<span class="caps">PHP</span>&#8217;);</pre><br />in ruby<br /><pre>Project.find_by_language(&#8216;<span class="caps">PHP</span>&#8217;)</pre><br /><br />This is a very simple example, i will try to find out how well it goes when trying to preforms something more complicated in Akelos.</p>
