<p>A while ago i posted a post about a Globalize plugin bug in Rails 2.&#215;. Eventually i found a solution but i was still waiting for a real solution for Rails 2.x to supersede my monkey patching. <br />
<br />
Well, it&#8217;s here.<br />

Globalize2 is the successor of Globalize for Rails.<br />
<br />
It is compatible with and builds on the new I18n api in Ruby on Rails. and adds model translations as well as a bunch of other useful features, such as Locale fallbacks (RFC4647 compliant) and automatic loading of Locale data from defined directory/file locations.<br />
<br />
Globalize2 is much more lightweight and modular than its predecessor was. Content translations in Globalize2 use default ActiveRecord features and do not limit any functionality any more.<br />
<br />
All features and tools in Globalize2 are implemented in the most unobstrusive and loosely-coupled way possible, so you can pick whatever features or tools you need for your application and combine them with other tools from other libraries or plugins.<br /></p>
