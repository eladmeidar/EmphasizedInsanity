<p>JQuery (for those of you just landed from Mars) is an unobtrusive javascript framework. read more at the <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery home page</a>.<br />jQuery supports Behavior driven development and is based on traversing <span class="caps">HTML</span> documents by <span class="caps">CSS</span> Selectors.<br />vs.<br />Prototype,<br />Prototype is also JavaScript library for Class driven development which makes life easier working with JavaScript. Prototype library has a good support in Ruby on Rails via helper functions and is basically well embedded in.<br /><br />i decided to try to match both of these libraries (and dojo for the matter of fact, but the project was halted), and here are my conclusions.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><span class="caps">BDD</span><br /><br /><br />JQuery is very similar to <span class="caps">CSS</span> by assigning the <span class="caps">HTML</span> element behaviour out-side the <span class="caps">HTML</span>, so it is generally more adequate for <span class="caps">MVC</span>.<br />for ex:<br /><code>&lt;br /&gt; $(element).click(function() {&lt;br /&gt;         alert("warning");&lt;br /&gt; });&lt;br /&gt;</code><br />simple.<br /></li><br /><li>Chaining<br />Chining methods is as simple as ruby. period<br /></li><br /><li><span class="caps">CSS</span> Selectors<br /><br />Since JQuery is based upon <span class="caps">CSS</span>, you can access any element by it&#8217;s <span class="caps">CSS</span> path, and avoid these annoying pesky ID&#8217;s you have to put using Prototype.<br /></li><br /></ul><br />for some more comparisons, visit the Ajaxian article<br /><br />Finally:<br />Jquery and prototype are both great. For me, i prefer JQuery since it&#8217;s approach appeals to me more than Prototype&#8217;s, Although prototype is kinda Rubish and has inbound support from Rails, JQuery is still cleaner to me.<br />Did someone said  JQuery to Rails integration?</p>
