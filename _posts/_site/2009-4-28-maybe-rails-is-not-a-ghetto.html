<p>I wrote this post fast, and while i&#8217;m pretty pissed off, please excuse any grammar mistakes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.afreshcup.com">Mike Gunderloy</a> had decided today <a href="http://afreshcup.com/2009/04/28/a-painful-decision/">to resign from his position in the Rails activists team</a> following a debate between him and some of the other Rails core members on their approach to female programmers and that stupid porn related Couchdb presentation (which wasn&#8217;t that good anyway).</p>
<p>I am not really in the state of knowing what happened there, or why this had to happen in the first place, but i do know that mike is valuable asset to this community and i&#8217;m pretty sure he is far more valuable than the fucking porn presentation or any other stupid RailsConf presentation there might be.</p>
<p>Mike is one of the most active activists, he created some of the best guides out there for beginners (his <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html">Routing</a> guide finally got me into using RESTful routing) and for existing users too. i had seen him help around <code>#rubyonrails</code> and answering questions with the precision of an Israeli Mossad assassin,  i even had to honor to work with him on some experimental advanced Rails Model generator, and i had a blast doing so.<br />
A &#8220;community&#8221; is not about the hype, i didn&#8217;t care when Alex Payne said &#8220;Rails doesn&#8217;t scale&#8221; or any of his other BS and his men-love to scala.. why? because it was harmless, he was only making a fool of himself and nobody really thought about quitting rails because &#8220;Alex said that scala is better&#8221;.<br />
This is different, here there&#8217;s a real damage to the community, for a price i&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s willing to pay.</p>
<p>My mom used to say that &#8220;if you don&#8217;t respect what you are doing, no one else is going to respect you either&#8221;, so if you degrade your level of professionalism to a mare &#8220;Hi! it&#8217;s porn and it&#8217;s funny, LET&#8217;S <span class="caps">USE</span> IT IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">RAILSCONF</span>&#8221; is a stupid decision, done by stupid people.<br />
When i say stupid&#8230; i don&#8217;t mean that these people are not <strong>smart</strong>, just that they are not <strong>wise</strong>. In Hebrew there&#8217;s a saying that goes something like &#8220;A smart person can get out of a hole, a wise person will not fall in to&#8221;, and that&#8217;s exactly the case.</p>
<p>Again, i don&#8217;t really know what happened in there but from reading DHH&#8217;s last few posts(<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/40-alpha-male-programmers-arent-keeping-women-out">#1</a>, <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/39-im-an-r-rated-individual">#2</a>), i can only imagine what it&#8217;s like to try to engage a reasonable conversation with someone like that.. again.. smart.. yeah&#8230; wise?<br />
I am sure he is not the only one to blame for this mess, but it&#8217;s not the first time i sense that kind of approach from his direction, ever since that <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/david-heinemeier-hansson-says-no-to-use-of-rails-logo-567.html">&#8217;i&#8217;m <span class="caps">DHH</span> (<span class="caps">GOD</span>) <span class="caps">AND</span> I <span class="caps">OWE</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> NOTHING&#8217;</a> incident, the strange feeling that someone is might be a little megalomaniac-eesh began to nest in my head.<br />
It came even stronger after reading Zed Shaw&#8217;s &#8220;Rails is a ghetto&#8221; article (which he removed recently) although i didn&#8217;t fully understand his strong position, today i guess i can see it too.</p>

<p>I am not a core contributor (although i wanted to be), i am not a Working With Rails top 100 resident, and i am not a super duper extra smart web developer like a lot of other people from this community, i am only a guy that is deeply disappointed with the approach of the people who suppose to lead this community and their priorities.</p>
<p>I really hope this whole issue is going to end on the good side, and that this community will not lose one more of it&#8217;s most precious contributors (like it lost <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a> to Django), there aren&#8217;t as many people as talented as these two.<br />
I was considering in the last few days whether i should go to the RailsConf, a decision that may had to require me to a 12 flight to Israel for a friend&#8217;s wedding and only 4 hours later back to the US (another 12 hours to new york and from there to to Las Vegas)&#8230;.</p>
<p>I am not coming, and now i am happy with it.</p>
