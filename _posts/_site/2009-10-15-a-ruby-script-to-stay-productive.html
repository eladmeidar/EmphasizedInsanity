<p>Avoiding temptations, i was doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Lately i found myself wasting too much time on stuff that weren&#8217;t so &#8220;work&#8221; related, like tweeting, facebook&#8217;ing and all the other stuff the interwebs flashes in your face in order to distract you from making money.</p>
<p>A while ago when i moved my development stack to use a local Passenger/Apache installation, i decided to use the <a href="http://github.com/bjeanes/ghost">ghost</a> gem to add custom hosts for my projects, just to make it easier to reference. (ex: for a project that was on eladisawesome.com, i used th ghost gem to point eladisawesome.dev to my local dev stack).</p>
<p>Then, it hit me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you write a tiny script that will block all that interwebs blasphemy and keep you productive?&#8221;</p>
<p>There it is, enjoy. (forks and enhancements are welcome, of course).</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/210612.js"></script><p>usage is pretty simple (you might be required to enter your root password, after all, we are adding hosts here):<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/210613.js"></script></p>
<p>Well, i know it&#8217;s kind of stupid, but every time i hit a local page when i try to hit those pages, i come back to my senses and go back to work&#8230; if you can&#8217;t even do that, you should find a better solution.</p>
