<p>We all love auto complete. It makes our lives a little less complicated and classy. I decided to (as a complimantry to my new JS beloved framework) to use the JQuery autocomplete plugin, problems began when I needed to use dynamically added text fields with autocomplete. Since the plugin assumes that you use a single and unique <span class="caps">DOM</span> ID, was unable to setup the autocomplete feature to newly dynamic fields.<br />One solution was to add the fields by javascript and Dom manipulation, but I prefered to use a partial in order to keep the code simple and Rubish. The other solution was to add a javascript script tag in the end of the partial which traverses the <span class="caps">DOM</span> and adds a unique and random id, and of course setting the auto complete feature for each one of them.<br />Bottom line, it is working and even working well, but I would like to hear new ideas if anyone has.<br />Over and out.</p>
