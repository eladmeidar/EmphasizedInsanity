<p>In the last couple of days (weeks? i lost track) iv&#8217;e been hunting for some new rails developers for a new team i am starting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p>In the beginning, i believed it will not take me more than a couple of days to find me a couple of brave, relentless and sharp Rails ninjas to hold our new fort.</p>
<p><strong>i was wrong</strong></p>
<p>After doing about 8 interviews with people (some even came by flight) i must say that i never thought that people have that kind of nerve to do what they did.. here are my chronicles:</p>
<h4>The <span class="caps">UFO</span></h4>
<p>This guy just landed out of nowhere, got him of a Linkedin ad i posted on the RubyOnRails group. He seemed really smart at the beginning, his profile picture seemed ok too, so i decided to go on with the interview anyway &#8220;maybe it&#8217;s just a bad day&#8221; i thought.</p>
<p>He walked into my office smelling like the Mc&#8217;donalds kids menu, wearing a <span class="caps">KISS</span> t-shirt and untied shoes&#8230; now i&#8217;m not the person who sets his opinions based on first impressions, but this was way over the line.</p>
<p>I think that guy was high too, every second word was &#8220;<span class="caps">HUH</span>?&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="caps">MMM</span>&#8221; and he couldn&#8217;t answer a simple question like, &#8220;where was your last job?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Result: 10 minutes, and he was on his way home.</p>
<h4>The Liar</h4>
<p>Me: &#8220;For how long have you been working with rails?&#8221;<br/>
Liar: &#8220;about 2 years&#8221;<br/>
Me: &#8220;Ok, what do you think about the ActiveRecord :include option? would you use that or prefere an <span class="caps">SQL</span> <span class="caps">JOIN</span>?&#8221;<br/>
Liar: &#8220;Wait&#8230;ActiveRecord?&#8221;<br/></p>
<h4>The <span class="caps">REALLY</span> <span class="caps">BAD</span> Liar</h4>
<p>Me: &#8220;For how long have you been working with rails?&#8221;<br/>
Liar: &#8220;7 years&#8221;<br/></p>
<p><span class="caps">WTF</span>?!</p>
<h4>The human FAILed debugger</h4>
<p>This guy was pretty cool actually, so he made it to the next level where i gave him a simple application that i made, with all kinds of bugs in it on purpose, and had him sit on it for a while and identify these bugs.</p>
<p>One of the bugs was a buggy <code>config.gem</code> statement, which made him realize the amazing conclusion that &#8220;You don&#8217;t have Rails installed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<h4>More people</h4>
<p>I hope not, but if there will be something worth mentioning, it will be here.</p>
