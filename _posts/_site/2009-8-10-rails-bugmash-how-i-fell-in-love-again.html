<p>In this past weekend, i had the pleasure of taking part in a <a href="http://wiki.railsbridge.org/projects/railsbridge/wiki/BugMash">Rails BugMash</a>, ran by some of the Rails core members and a few <a href="http://railsbridge.org">RailsBridge</a> team-leaders and officers.</p>
<p>I have to say, that when i initially thought about taking part of this fest, i was pretty concerned about the fact.. that i never committed anything to the rails core and that i am not very skilled with some of the necessary tools such as Git and Rails testing. I was thrilled to see how helpful the community was, from the eyes of the #railsbridge <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel resident, i saw a live, ass-kicking community that joined both experienced and new developers in an effort to make the framework better, and the developers more related to it.</p>
<p>That 48 hours of digging, testing, Git&#8217;ing, Ticket-bashing did wonders to my Rails and other tools skills, i got great, precise and considerate help and support when i needed, personal guidance on demand and on top of it, <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/elad-meidar/commits">i got 2 patches in</a> and <a href="http://bugmash.heroku.com/">scored</a> (#6) a lot higher than i would expected, yai!.</p>
<p>I even got a souvenir :)</p>

<p>Having participated in an event like this made me a better developer in my opinion, and as a person who always learning doing something new and never gives up (&#8220;Die facebook <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221;), i feel like i achieved something that i wanted to for a long time.</p>
<p>Anyway, i had a blast, learned so much about the framework and other stuff, got to know people i only heard about, new people as well, and witnessed the mission and statement of #railsbridge coming true in the very first time they were put to the test.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know who-did-what in order to make it happen, so i&#8217;ll just hand it over to who ever did, thank you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll anxiously wait for the next bash.</p>
<p>p.s,<br />
