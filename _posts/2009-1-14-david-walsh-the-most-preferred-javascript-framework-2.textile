David Walsh, one of my favorite RSS destinations, posted a poll a while ago in order to get a quick look over the preferred javascript framework in use these days.<br />
Well the winner is <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/preferred-javascript-framework-fu">JQuery</a>, but not in a too wide margin from MooTools at the back, at least not as i thought it would be.<br />
I personally voted for JQuery at that time, but since i switch frameworks depanding on the project nesecities, i think my vote is divided equally by MooTools and JQuery. Dojo was well at the back with only 2 (!!) votes and a close to 0% of vote share, kind of a surprise to me, i was really impressed by Dojo and was considering using it, or at least benchin' it out a little bit.
