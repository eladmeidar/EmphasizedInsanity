i just love those web2.0 small time project, where people make their own application for something they wanted, and it turns out to be a Tsunami of digg hits.<br /><a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/">yougetsignal.com</a> is a great website with some various network tools for checking connectivity, domains, hosts, and traces (even phones) all of that within a great UI design.<br />really nice, and in the owners words:<br /><quote><br />YouGetSignal.com is a collection of network tools that I started working on in late September of 2007. The name of the site, YouGetSignal, is a nerdy play on a line of broken English from the infamous "All your base are belong to us" cut scene. <br /></quote>
