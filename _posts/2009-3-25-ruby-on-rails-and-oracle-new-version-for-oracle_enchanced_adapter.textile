A new version for the "oracle_enhanced_adapter is now out":http://blog.rayapps.com/2009/03/23/activerecord-oracle-enhanced-adapter-also-on-jruby-and-ruby-19/, which is exciting for those of use who chose to work with Oracle.
Use can use the Oracle enhanced adapter:
* on MRI 1.8.6 with ruby-oci8 1.0.x library or gem
* on JRuby (so far tested with 1.1.6) with JDBC Oracle driver
* on Ruby/YARV 1.9.1 with ruby-oci8 2.0 library or gem

And, which is the coolest, *Oracle enhanced adapter passes 100% ActiveRecord unit tests!*

install the new adapter by:
<pre class="brush: bash">
$ sudo gem install activerecord-oracle_enahnced-adapter
</pre>

*note that some of the SQL compatible with Mysql and is used by rails, is not compatible with Oracle*, so run your tests again.
