As you all well know, i am a proud member of new rails community named "RailsBridge":http://blog.eizesus.com/2009/5/announcing-railsbridge-com. 

I signed myself up to be responsible of this community main website which basically means i need to 

# develop it.
# design it.
# maintain it.

I gathered up some help around the IRC channel (<code>#railsbridge</code>) and the "Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge/browse_thread/thread/dc3412fe7a2cd038 and it's going to be fun. :)
But, as fun as it may sound, we do need to get some help doing so from other members of the rails community, So if you feel like helping out in forming a new, cool, fun and professional "community":http://www.railsbridge.com, just let me know on the comments, one "Twitter":http://twitter.com/eladmeidar the ""Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge/ or on the IRC channel.
