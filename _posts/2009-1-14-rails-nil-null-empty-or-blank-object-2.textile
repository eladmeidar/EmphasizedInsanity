title: Rails nil, null empty or blank object

From the rails Ruby Object extenstion, The Object#blank? is now covering nil, blank and empty responses:
<pre class="brush: ruby">
elad = nil
elad.blank? # true
</pre>
and even empty containers
<pre class="brush: ruby">
elad = []
elad.blank? # true
</pre>
<em>note: Remember that this is a Rails extension to Ruby's Object, so it will not work on IRB, but will on console.</em>
