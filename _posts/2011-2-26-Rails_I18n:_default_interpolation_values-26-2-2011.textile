title: Rails I18n - default interpolation values
layout: post
---

In the past few weeks i've been busy I18n'ing on of the applications i'm working on. As everyone already know and i assume also agree, 
I18n'ing adult applications is a real PITA.

one of the problems i was facing is the need to find and replace a certain string that appeared in 30+ translation values. One option
was to go over one by one and replace that string with an interpolation key in the translations - after that working hard to also add that interpolation value to
every place one of the translation keys was called... shiish. 

Lazy as i'm i thought it would have been nice if Rails knew how to grab default interpolation values from somewhere so i decided to give it a try

this is a first draft and a VERY ugly mixin i wrote that loads default values from SettingsLogic (in this case, edit your own):

i hope it helps.
