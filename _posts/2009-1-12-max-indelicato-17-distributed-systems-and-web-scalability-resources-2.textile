Well, scaling an application in my opinion, i like doing the dishes after a really big dinner, nobody wants to do it, but you have to.<br />
Just leaving it there will only make the process of cleaning and washing the dishes worst, and might add some more problems on the way.<br />
Max Indelicato stats in his blog a list of <a href="http://blog.maxindelicato.com/2009/01/17-distributed-systems-and-web-scalability-resources.html">17 Distributed Systems and Web Scalability Resources</a> which makes it easier to understand and to implement a proper application scaling policy, <b>and on time</b>.
