<quote>"In his keynote talk at the recent Silicon Valley Ruby Conference, Sun’s <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Tim">Tim Bray</a> asserted that “PHP and Ruby are the languages of choice for new web apps.” Coming from most people, this wouldn’t be a remarkable comment, but given that Tim is Sun’s director of web technologies, it is worthy of note. Java wasn’t even on Tim’s list, much less his recommended solution."</quote><br />
