The apache <code>rewrite</code> engine is pretty cool, it allows you handle the user's request and preform actions (redirect, block...) according to a pattern given as parameter.
This main use for rewrites i guess, is to enable pretty URL outside your app, or to support legacy conventions. (Like i should have done here when i moved to mephisto).
