Mootools is awesome, but it still lacks some of the features that JQuery has when dealing with effects and some other not-so-important stuff.<br />
Moo.rd is an excellent extension which implements some more features back to mootools. features such as some extra effects (finally, a mootools shake effect!), windows, sliders and more.<br />
recommended, <a href="http://www.moord.it/">get it here</a>.
