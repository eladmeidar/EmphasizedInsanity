I fear the rails community is getting closer and closer to fulfill my vision of <code>acts_as_what_i_want</code>plugin.
"YouveGotRails.com":http://www.youvegotrails.com/ allows one to generate a rails application with plugins and gems of choice, along side some extra configuration options (Git and Capistrano Initialization).

Nice, useful?
