---
We've been working for a while on our biggest project (Aviation industry related), and it's keeping my team busy too much in the past few weeks, and they can't seem to reach other tasks.
So, i decided to open a seperate development team to handle this project and i am looking for Rails developers to man it in the near future:


*Job Requirements*

# Rails 2.x experience (duh!).
# jQuery (mootools too would be nice).
# Since it's an in-house job, you should be living around Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
# Proven experience and recommendations would be nice too.

Contact me via:
* "Twitter":http://twitter.com/eladmeidar, 
* The <code>#rubyonrails</code> IRC channel on <code>irc.freenode.net</code> as <code>eladmeidar</code>.
* or via my email address at my "home page":http://www.eizesus.com.

See ya!
