* "Fat free CRM":http://www.fatfreecrm.com/ - CRM in Rails, nice.
* "RubyRep, JRuby database replication":http://www.rubyrep.org/ - Simple and clean, supports only Postgres and Mysql for now.
* "Using HTML5 today":http://www.sitepoint.com/article/html-5-snapshot-2009/ - @NewSwf, this one is for you :), although expected fully only in 2022 (pessimistic somewhat), there's no need to wait for all the browsers to care about HTML5, you can start goofing around today.
* "Mike Gunderloy 'Rails Rescue Handbook'":http://www.railsinside.com/news/297-rails-rescue-handbook-by-mike-gunderloy.html - got a broken app? this awesome book by the awesome "Mike Gunderloy":http://afreshcup.com is exactly what you need to get your project back on track.
* "Develop a Facebook application lessons":http://www.stylephp.com/2009/06/28/lets-develop-a-facebook-application-part-one/ - This guy is stepping into hell (in PHP for that matter), i sure as hell would like to see how he gets around the awful, dreadful, hideous Facebook API.


In other matters, the offical "Railsbridge":http://www.railsbridge.org was released today, no thanks to me. i was supposed to lead this thing into it's first step, but was unable to exclude myself out of the day to day tasks who overtook me by numbers.
Thanks to Mike Gunderloy and the other awesome, amazing Railsbridge dudes who did it all by themselves and made it real. you guys rock and i will repay my debt to society.

That's it.
