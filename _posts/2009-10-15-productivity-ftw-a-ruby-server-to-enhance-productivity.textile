I got some great responses for my simple "Ruby productivity script":http://blog.eizesus.com/2009/10/a-ruby-script-to-stay-productive so i decided to make it a little better.

it now has lasers. (HTTP server).

Check out the "new source from GitHub":http://github.com/eladmeidar/productivity_ftw/fast_forward and lunch your own productivity enhancing server.

h4. Installation

just checkout the source:
<pre>git clone git://github.com/eladmeidar/productivity_ftw.git</pre>

and fire off the productivity enhancing server:
<pre>
sudo ruby productivity_ftw.rb
</pre>

note that you *have to use sudo* cause you are taking over port 80, not sure if it's required on windows also.

h4. Adding more hosts to block

open the <code>b-productive.rb</code> file and add to the <code>BLOCK_LIST</code> host array, a better solution is welcome, i am just lazy.

h4. "Thank you"s
