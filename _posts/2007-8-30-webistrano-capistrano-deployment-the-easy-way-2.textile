It lets you manage projects and their stages like test, production, and staging with different settings. Those stages can then be deployed with Capistrano through Webistrano.<br /><br /><img width=350 src="http://blog.innerewut.de/files/webistrano/images/projects.png" /><br /><br />Webistrano's purpose is to make the deployment of multi-stage and multi-environment scenarios easy. Further it allows you to track who deployed what when to which servers and be alerted by email on each deployment.<br /><br />Webistrano itself is a Ruby on Rails application that includes an edge version of Rails and all needed dependencies like Capistrano or Net::SSH. The only required dependencies are Ruby, Rake, and a database.<br />Currently the deployment part of Webistrano does not run on Windows.<br />The code is hosted at Rubyforge and distributed under the BSD license. <br /><br />Webistrano can be downloaded <a href="http://blog.innerewut.de/files/webistrano/webistrano-1.0.zip">here</a>
