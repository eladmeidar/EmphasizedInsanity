<p>Many times when using a belongs_to relation, we encounter the need to size up that association, we can use 2 methods which are created for us, size and (association_pluralization)_count.so if SuperHero has_many :super_powers than:me = SuperHero.find(1)me.super_powers.sizeme.super_powers_countthey will both issue that same SQL statement at this pointSELECT count(<em>) as count_all FROM super_powers WHERE (super_hero_id = 1)which basically preforms a SELECT</em> statement, we don&#8217;t like it :)the :counter_cache parameter for the belongs_to macro, indicates the use of a (association_pluralization)_count named column which will be incremented and decremented according to the use of the associative array, this can and does save a lot of time and DB - APP - DB roundup&#8217;s.</p>
