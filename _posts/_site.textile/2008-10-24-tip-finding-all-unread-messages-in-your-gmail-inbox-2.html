<p>I have about 3000+ mail and i get something like 20-40 relevant messages a day, i usually very orgenized and i sort the incoming messages once an hour.<br />Now i had about unread messages that i missed in my inbox and wanted to find them, after a short quest i found this:<br /><br />in the top search enter<br /><code><br />label:unread in:inbox<br /></code><br />and yaaa, all unread messages are found. you can drop the <code>in:inbox</code> and get your entire list of unread messages, including other labels.</p>
