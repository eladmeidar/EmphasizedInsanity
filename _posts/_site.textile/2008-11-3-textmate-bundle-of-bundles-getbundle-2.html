<p>There are 124 bundles for TextMate where only 36 are included by default. Until recently, the way to get more bundles has been to install subversion and then do a checkout of the bundles needed (from the shell.) or download a .tmbundle file.<br /> <br /> Now there is a much easier way: the <strong>GetBundle bundle by Sebastian Gräßl</strong>. All you need to do is download and double click it to get an “Install Bundle” command which you can invoke from inside TextMate (hint: use ??T and enter “install”.)<br /> <br /> There is also an “Update all Bundles” command which you can use to update your custom installed bundles to the latest version. A future version of the bundle is likely to offer a launchd Daemon that you can install to have updating taken care of automatically.<br /> <br /> All bundles installed via the GetBundle end up in ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Pristine Copy/Bundles.<br /> <br /> <br /> Get it <a href='http://is.gd/4Bhf'>here</a>, since the original repo isn&#8217;t working.</p>
