<p>This plugin imports a rails project into subversion (excluding tmp files, logs and more) and converts the current directory to a working copy of that project.<br /><br />SvnImport goes a little bit further than just adding everything; it ignores resources such as logs, tmp files and database.yml and environment.rb.<br /><br />For the database.yml and environment.rb files, SvnImport creates template files, and provides a task for copying them back after checkout. This allows each developer to have their own database settings and/or keep the password for the production database out of version control. <br /><br /><h3>Installation</h3><br /><br /><code><br />script/plugin install https://svn.cjohansen.no/rails/plugins/svn_import/trunk <br /></code><br /><br /><h3>Usage</h3><br /><br /><code><br />rake svn:import<br /></code><br /><br />This task will only successfully run once - before the applicaton has been added to subversion. Once it&#8217;s been added, the task will no longer do anything. When a new developer checks out the project, she can get the standard setup by doing:<br /><br /><code><br />rake svn:setup<br /></code><br /><a href='http://en.cjohansen.no/prosjekter/svn_import'><br />Source</a></p>
