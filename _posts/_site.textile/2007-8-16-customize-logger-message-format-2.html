<p>I Hate these long, frustrating long messages coming out on me when i look at the log. They are long, and needed a refreshing change for my opinion.here is what i found:There is a method which is responsible for the actual STDOUT printing for the log file, it&#8217;s called Logger#format_message. I decided to overrun it in a more pretty way.I created a /lib library called logger_format.rb and required it in environment.rb,class Logger def format_message(level, time, progname, msg) &#8220;#{time.to_s(:long)} &#8211; #{msg}\n&#8221; end end for example.try it out and feel free to modify the output structure at will.</p>
