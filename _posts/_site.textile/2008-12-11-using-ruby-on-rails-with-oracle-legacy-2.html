<p>Great slide on SlideShare.<br /> introduces the ruby-plsql gem, which makes it easier to preform database functions and stored procedures from ruby/rails applications (and supports bind variables).<br /> i personally wrote a module of my own to handle this need (which supports bind variables as well).<br /> Check out the slide and pay attention to the <code>oracle_enhanced_adapter</code> now available.<br /> The slide is over <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/rsim/using-ruby-on-rails-with-legacy-oracle-databases-presentation'>here at SlideShare</a>.</p>
