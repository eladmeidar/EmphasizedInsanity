title: Deploying Ruby on Rails on EC2 - Deploying Oracle
layout: post

Well, generally i use Oracle for my large scale applications.<br />
Some people might say that it's not too-competible with Rails, but using the <a href="http://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced/tree/master">oracle_enhanced_adapter</a> didn't pop up any special issues (it even supports Oracle's bind variables technique).<br />
The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/cloud/index.html?rssid=rss_otn_news">Oracle Cloud Deployment tutorials</a> on Oracle's website contains explanations, PDFs, tutorials and demos on how and when to deploy Oracle DB in the cloud.<br />
Extra guides include backup and recovery practices.
